once he had looked whether or no he could prove it)
that it was the Crelellitti $1013 which caufeth the heat
and firength of the right fide of the Body, which in-
deed is no fuch matter, for it is the idicTocopnical Sun
within the Body which gives the heat to it, and the
Jklcrocormical Moon which gives the radical moifture,
and that 1 prove by this Argument, Becaufe man is in-
ternally hottcfl in the Winter time, when the cfflefiiil
Sue is at the greatth diflance from him, as appears by
thequicknefs of his digeflion then. Each Stone bath
     a Mufcle, which the Learned call cremaler,
Mulch's. from the Greek word xceptcliv, which fign it
     fies to hold up,bccaufe they pull up the flones
in the a& of generation, that fo the veciels being flack-
ned, may the better void the Seed. Age and ficknefs
weaken theft Mufcles, and then the Stones hang down
lower than they do in youth and health.
    The Ufa of the Stones is, â€¢ 1. To convert blood
uft. and fpirit into Seed. for the procreation of Man,
   and yet by your leaves, they convert not all the
blood that come to them into feed, but keep fore for
their own noutifhment. 2. They add heatArength and
courage to the Body,and that appears, becaufe Eunuchs
are neither fo firong,hot, nor valiant as other men ; nei-
ther is an Ox fo hot or valiant as a Bull.
 As for the Tunicles or Skins that cover and enwrap
the Stones,they conducing nothing to our prefent fcope,
I willingly omitted them.

from thence carry out the Seminal matter ; from the .
other extremity packes that Veal called fAculateriur.
