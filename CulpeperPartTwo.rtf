\cf4 1. When hard hair comes \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 orth suddenly, thick, black, and long, and large about; if they come forth slow, thin, soft, yellowish, and but few not spreading the womb is cold.\
Also when the ter\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 s come forth at twelve years of age, it is a \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 ign of a hot womb, and when they last long, the blood is red, hot, but not ve
\f2 \uc0\u8739

\f2 \uc0\u8739 
\f0 ter, and the blood is cold and waterish, and they end sooner. If it be hot and moist, they flow plentifully, and last till after fifty. If it be hot and dry, the blood is yellow, thin and sharp, and pricks the privities.\
If it be cold and moist, the blood comes late forth, with difficulty, and it is whitish and thin. If it be cold and dry, the terms come forth very late, and with difficulty, and seldom continue till forty, and the blood is thick and little.\
The third sign is from Lechery, for they who have hot wombs desire copulation \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 ooner and more vehemently, and are much delighted th\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 r
\f2 \uc0\u8739

The hot and dry have great lust, and a Frenzie if they want it; but they are quickly \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 ired, because there are but few Spirits. If it be cold and moist, they are not soon lecherous, and are \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 asily satis
\f2 \uc0\u8739 
\f0 fied; and if they miscarry often, the womb is made colder, and they delight not in the sport: but copulation doth them good, and makes them more youthful. If it be cold and dry, they desire not a man in a long time, and take no delight, because the Spirits are few.\
The fourth sign is from often conception, for the hot conceive often, and bring forth males or Viragoe's, if the seed of the man agree with it.\

\cf4 The cold doth the contrary.\
A hot and moist womb is very fruitful, if the man be wel tempered, and though he be old and weak, yet she will conceive by him: sometimes they have twins, or over do, and have a mole.\
Hot and dry are fruitful, but not so much as the former.\
Cold and moist, are hard to conceive, especi

A cold and dry womb is commonly barren, and if they conceive, the mans seed is hot and moist, they bring forth \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 emales; and if males, they are tall, and quickly look old.\

When a woman is sound, and useth a sound man, the womb by degrees swells, and the child moves in its time, but often there is a Dropsi\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4  with conception before or after; therefore in a Dropsie the tumor is equal, according to the largeness of the womb and \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 elly, and no\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4  point

\f2 \uc0\u8739 
\f0 rits, and well tempered, and a fit subject for a Soul, and that both spend at a time, and there be mixed and retained together, to produce a child.\
Also the sucking of the womb is necessary, and that it should lay it up and embrace it, so that there be no space between the seed and the womb. Somtimes the womb greedily snatcheth and emb\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 aceth the seed, but doth not keep it, bu\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4  lets it come forth two or three daies after, or keeps it to no purpose, and brings it not to action, as in a false conception or mole. Moreover there must be blood in readiness to get the child, or be sprinkle it when it is first \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 ormed, and to nourish it after.\
Therefore if te\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 ms be wanting as in girls, o\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4  be stopt, or gone as in old \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 olk, expect no con

If all these be right, there is conception, o

\f2 \uc0\u8739 
\f0 cause there must be a certain proportion between both seeds: and if they be wanting, they are bar
\f2 \uc0\u8739 
\f0 ren, which proportion is hard to be explained, and almost impossible; for we must not stay in the first qualities, for there are occult qualities in seed, by which they agree or disagree.\
The third cause, is when the womb su\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 ks not in the seed, nor receives it in a right manner, as when the attractive faculty is hurt, or hindered by divers distempers of the womb, or when a woman hates her Husband.\

\f0\i0  But the more probable reason of not conceiving, is the matter of the seed turning into fat.\
The fourth cause, is the retention of the seed hurt by a moist distemper, then the womb is weak and the fibres are loose, so that it cannot con\'a6tract it self to retain; and the seed by reason of its sliminess, cannot stick there. Also if the wo\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 b be too thick, not fleshy and \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 o\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 t, and be not sp\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 in

The last cause of barrenness, is want of men

\f0 mation of the child. Therefore Nurses that have much milk conceive, because the blood is carri

\f0 ed to the breasts.\
Therefore all these causes are reduced either to impotency in copulation, or distemper of the stones and seed-vessels, or evil conformation, or \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4  cold and moist distemper of the womb, which can
\f2 \uc0\u8739

The Mothers blood is required to enlarge the child to perfection. 3. There is required a good constitution of the womb to nourish the seed, and stir the concealed force.

Others are dete\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 minate errors, not simply from the imagination by the pallions which have no determination to such a thing; but no other cause can be besides the imagination, but how she directs the forming faculty for the producing of such effects, it is hard to be understood, but there must be some imagination and the forming faculty, that it may impart the species sent from the external senses to the forming faculty.\
And this is the cause of the consent of the up
\f2 \uc0\u8739 
\f0 per and lower faculties: for the \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 oul is the same in the whole body; and every where \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 itted with the same faculties, but it doth not exercise all in all parts, but by the proper determinate organs \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\'95\cf4 \strokec4  instruments.\
And though the child hath its \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 oul, yet while it is in the womb, it depends upon the \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 oul of the mother, as the fruits partake of the life of the tree while they are upon it, therefore it is probable, that whatsoever moves the faculties of the \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 oul in the mother may move the same in the child: Hence it is that while the forming o

Two things are to be observed in this won

\f0 derful history, first why the Child in the time of tra\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 ail being dead in the womb did not stink as is usual, or kill the mother suddenly, or was not \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 ast out by degrees being rotten? secondly by what force the child was turn'd into Stone?\
For the first, The mother lived twenty eight years after she had this Child, therefore it is not credible that the womb was so cold that it might hinder putre\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 action, as some think. It seems more probable to me, that these questions expla

\f0 nation depend upon one principle, for the cause that made the stones hardness, kept the child from putre\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 action, but what that is, it is obs\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 ure.\
Many fly to the efficien\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 y of the fi\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 st qualities, others to driness, others to coldness, others to both.

The principles of generation were weak in this child and impure, and this stone-breeding \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\'95\'95\cf4 \strokec4 ce was mixed with the blood in the humors, hence it is that it was not born alive, as in a wole bred in the womb, which women have \cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 i\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 l they a\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 e old and die with it, and yet it s\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\cf4 \strokec4 i\cf5 \strokec5 \'95\'95\cf4 \strokec4 s
