      <h2>The aim of this project is to search through early modern texts to find further understanding about early modern conceptions of female anatomy, specifically hints about the seven-celled uterus doctrine.</h2>
      <p>The seven-celled uterus was the medical understanding that a woman's uterus had seven chambers instead of one. One of the first mentions of this doctrine comes from a Pseudo-Galenic text called <em>De Spermate</em>, but <em>De Spermate</em> itself has questionable origins. My overall project will ask: where <em>De Spermate</em> originated from when it became widely disseminated, which medical authors first began spreading the seven-cell idea, how popular the seven-cell doctrine was in elite medical circles, how popular the seven-cell uterus was in non-elite circles such as practicing midwives, when the doctrine was last used, why, how, and when it was replaced? My interest in this project lies in how such a large misconception regarding female anatomy endured for so long. I want to investigate what effects this untruth had on female patients, female practitioners and how the doctrine might have altered power-knowledge dynamics among individuals practicing medicine "professionally" or not. </p> 
      <p>It is unlikely that texts will mention the doctrine outright. More likely it will appear in reference to Galen, Mondino de Luzzi, or Michael Scot/Michael Scotus/Michael the Scot or their various published works. Mondino and Scot were Medieval physicians that popularized the pseudo-Galenic theory and are mentioned by other famous anatomists such as Andreas Vesalius as propagators of the "myth."</p>
      <p>Included here will be three different texts that are distinct, but may shed light, at the very least, on male and female understandings of gynaecology.</p>
