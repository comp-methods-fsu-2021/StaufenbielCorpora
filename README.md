WOMEN ON TRIAL
==============
This data set uses <em>Old Bailey Proceedings</em> to look at how women's bodies were put on trial. The cases that are investigated on this site are all about women accused of infanticide between the years of 1674 and 1789. Each of the 191 cases in this study also references a female midwife who was called in as an expert witness by the court to testify. There are many questions that these court records allow historians of medicine, the body, embodiment, gender, law, social and cultural history to ask.
