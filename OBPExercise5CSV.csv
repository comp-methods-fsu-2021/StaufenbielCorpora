Some account has already been given in Print of this business, but very false and imperfect, upon full Evidence it appeared only to be thus. This Midwife whether to satisfie her Husband (as she now alleadges) who was very Impatient to have a child, or whether it were to preserve her credit in her imploy which she thought somwhat prejudiced by the imputation of barrenness, I cannot say, but so it was she resolved to pretend to have a Child, in order hereunto by wearing a small Pillow, &c. she had perswaded many of her neighbors that she was great, and about a week before her pretended Labour enquired very earnestly of a poor Woman if she could not help her to a young Child as soon almost as born, either alive or dead, For says she there is a Lady whose husband will not live with her because she never had a Child, and he is now in the Country and if I could get a Child, I should do a good office in rendering love between them, and get something my self, but this Woman as she now swore, refused not knowing how to assist her; whereupon it seems she applied her self to the two searchers of Whitechappel, who having gratified her extravagant desires, on the 18. of April our Midwife pretends to fall in labour, but would not let any of the women touch her; and having dismist all save one in the Chamber, when she was got to bed, pretending great pains, her friend offering to put her hands into the Bed for better satisfying her self of her condition, she cried out Murder! Murder! Which raising a further suspicion in the woman, she did at last take out of the Bed a cold naked dead Child, which had, as appeared, been wrapt up in a Cloth, and seemed to have been a day or two old; whereupon she told the Prisoner this could be none of her child, who wickedly replyed with a horrid Curse and Imprecation on her self, if it were not her own child, born of her own body: However, Neighbours being called, several sober Matrons now deposed, that having searched her, they were confident she had no child at all, and that this was some other persons child, &c. The Prisoner being demanded where she had the child, declared of the two Searchers, which they being called to the Bar acknowledged, and that they brought it to her the same day, and had 20s. being promised 9l. more: That they had it on Saltpeter Bank.

Hereupon the Prisoner was suspected that it might be hers, and search'd by a Midwife and some Matrons, who were of opinion that she had a Childe, but not so lately: And indeed she confess'd, she had a year or two ago, a little one, but affirmed, that she was then married, and absolutely denied that she knew any thing of this Childe.

A Midwife likewise deposed, the Child was at its full Time; That examining her as to the Manner of its Birth, she told them that she was delivered in the Chamber, and that she got out of the Bed early in the Morning, spread a Gown and Petticoat on the Floor, lean'd upon a Chest of Drawers, and the Child came from her upon them; That there was a young Woman in the Room in Bed, with whom she lay, who was asleep ( she being a Quaker would not swear, and so could be no Evidence) and that she being very ill, went again to Bed, lay about 3 Hours, and then getting up, was carrying it down Stairs in the Gown and Petticoat, and was met by the Man. The Evidence deposed likewise that the Child was dead, and that there did not appear any Marks upon the Child of its having been hurt any where, except that there was a sort of a blackishCircle about the Child's Mouth (which a Midwife likewise deposed was usual to such Infants, tho'dying by a natural Death.) They likewise deposed that the Child was opened by a Surgeon, and that there did not appear to be any Water in the Body of the Child. In order to the better Information of the Jury in this Case, the Statute was read in Court, which was made to prevent the clandestine Births and concealing the Death of Bastard-Children, which enacted, That the concealing the Birth and Death of Bastard-Children should make the Mothers deem'd the Murtherers of them. The Prisoner, to put her self out of the Reach of this Act, alledged, that she was a married Woman at the time of her Conception, having been married to one Edward Wingate , who died same time before last Christmas. To prove this she had a Sister in Court, who deposed that she saw her married to the said Edward Wingate at Enfield Church. And others depos'd, they liv'd together for some time at Clerkenwell , and that the said Edward Wingate upon his Death-bed expressed his Concern in leaving her six Weeks gone with Child.

But the other's Evidence prevailing, she was deemed not to be affected by that Statute. The Matter then turning on another Hinge, it being the Prosecutor's Business to prove the Child was born alive and that she murthered it. She said it was Still-born, and that she neither perceived it to stir nor heard it to cry, and produc'd a considerable Quantity of Child-bed Linnen in Court, which was sworn she provided for her Delivery; and her Sister deposed she spoke to her three Months since to be her Nurse; and likewise a Midwife deposed, that two Months since, she spoke to her desiring her to come to her when she sent for her, telling her she look'd the latter End of July or beginning of August. And the chief Stress of the Matter then being whether the Child was murthered by her before putting into the Copper, or alive when she put it in: As to the first , the Evidences generally agreed there were no visible Tokens of any Violence offered to the Infant; and as to the latter, the Judge being of Opinion it was not alive when it was put in, because of what had been before testified, that at its being opened there was no Water found in the Body of it. A Surgeon being call'd to give his Opinion on the Matter, confirm'd his Lordship's Opinion, deposing upon Oath he was of Opinion that no human Body could be drowned without receiving some Quantity of Water into the Body, and consequently the Child could not be alive when put into the Copper. The Matter being thus, that there was no sufficient Proof that she had either murthered the Infant, or that it was born alive, tho' the Action was so unaccountably inhuman, for which she gave but little Satisfaction, the Jury acquitted her of the Indictment."

The Prisoner pleaded that the Child was Still born, and came before its Time; and that she had made her case known to a Midwife, and several other Persons, and that she had provided Necessaries for it. There were some Persons that confirm'd these Circumstances; a Midwife, an experinc'd Nurse, and some other Women, who saw the Child, gave their Opinions that it came four, five or six Weeks before its full time: and a Bailiff's Wife deposed, she came to her about 4 Months since, giving her 3 s.6 d. for a Writ to arrest one who she said she was with Child by, in order that having by that means secured him she might oblige him to provide for it.

She stood likewise charged, on the Coroner's inquest, for the like murder + Susanna Gillis . I am sister of Diot's ward in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The prisoner was six weeks in the Hospital with me, it is about six weeks ago. She was brought there for two sore legs; she had another complaint from getting cold by going into a damp cellar, which occasioned a disorder in her bowels. On the Thursday before the affair happened, she complained that disorder was worse than usual. The doctor ordered her a vomit, and on the Thursday after she complained she was worse, by the medicines that the doctor had ordered her, and said it burnt her inside up. Q. Do you remember the day of the month? Gillis. I do not, it was that night she was delivered. I went down to the apothecary, and brought her up a bolus. I went to her bed about a quarter after 8 at night, and missed her out of bed; she had used to keep her bed on the account of her legs being so bad, she only got out to have her bed made; I asked where she was gone, they told me to the necessary house; I sent Mary Evans the nurse, to see whether she was ill, or had fainted away; she came back and said, she was very bad, and could not come; I bid her go back with somebody with her and bring her in, for she would get cold. Q. How far was the necessary from the room where she lay? Gillis. It was about 3 or 4 yards from it. The nurse brought her back, and she went into bed. The nurse came to me and said, sister, there is something the matter, go and examine her. I went to her and asked, What was the matter with her? she answered, Nothing. Q. How long had she been at the necessary? Gillis. I cannot say. I said, I am sure there is something more than ordinary, I am sure Nanney you have had a child, or you have miscarried. She said she had not. Q. How came you to tax her with that? Gillis. Upon the nurse telling me what she saw in the necessary, I desired her to tell me the truth, and I would fetch a midwife, and have her examined; she still denied it, and I went and fetched Mrs. Smith the midwife, and was present when she examined her; the midwife brought the other part into the world, which was a plain proof there had been a child. I made her some caudle, and took proper care of her, and was up in the ward till after 2 in the morning; she said nothing while I was there, but after that she owned it. After the child was found, I saw it in the dead house, where bodies are put; it was a male child. Q. Have you had children? Gillis. I have had 8. Q. Did it appear to be a full grown child? Gillis. It did. Q. Did you observe any marks of violence upon it? Gillis. No, I did not, it was as fine a child as could be seen. On the Tuesday night before, when she took the vomit, I challenged her with being big; as she sat in the chair she looked like a woman down lying. I said to her, if you was not a sober woman I should suspect you to be with child. She said, indeed, sister, it is nothing but my petticoats and stays. Q. Did she call herself a single or a married woman? Gillis. She called herself a single woman, Mary Evans . I am the nurse in the Hospital. When the prisoner was missing from the bed, I was ordered to go to the necessary house to see after her; I went, and pushed the door open, and asked her, How she found herself? she said she was extremely ill; she then was sitting on the seat of the vault. Q. How long had she been there? M. Evans. I can't justly say how long; I said, sister desires you would come in, she is afraid you will get cold: she said she was in such extreme pain she could not get up: at that time I observed a great deal of blood upon the floor; I said, Nanney, you are very bad indeed (I had a candle in my hand) you seem to be in a very bad condition; said she, Nurse, the stuff that I have taken has forced the blood from me backwards and forwards, so that I can't tell what to do: I went directly from her to tell the sister in what manner she was, then sister ordered me to go back for her directly to have her into bed, fearing she should get cold; when I came back to the vault again she was got up, and had put the flap of the vault down, and was turning round to come out of the vault; I went to support her, she was very weak and tottered; the cloak she had on fell back, and by seeing her hand gave me suspicion something was the matter more than should be; she was half-way up her arm in blood; I said to her, Nanney, Nanney, what have you been at? I am afraid you have been flinging away your life in a very odd manner: she said, No, nurse, there is nothing the matter, I shall be better presently: I led her directly to her bed; as soon as I put her in, with her bed-gown and under petticoat on, I went back to the vault and saw it in a very bad condition, all the seat of the vault, the floor, and the funnel down the vault were bloody: I acquainted the sister with what I had seen and she examined her and went for the midwife; when the sister was gone I said there has certainly been a child: she said it was no such thing, it was only the apothecary's stuff: the other part was brought away afterwards, I was present: she said nothing till towards morning, then one of the patients and I taxed her with it; then she said the child was by a journeyman shoemaker, and owned she had been with child. Sarah Smith . I am a midwife, I was sent for about half an hour after 8 at night; the sister said there was a patient that they believed had miscarried; I found the prisoner sitting upright in bed, I desired her to lie down, I examined her and told the sister there was no child there, but soon I brought away the other part, she had been delivered of a child that evening, I thought at its full time by what appeared to me, but I never saw the child; she never spoke one word while I staid there; I saw the vault, and seat, and floor, they were very bloody. Q. From any thing you saw upon the vault, can you form any judgment with certainty whereabouts she was delivered? S. Smith. My opinion it was as she was sitting on the vault. Mary Tharp . I am a patient at the hospital; I saw the prisoner go to the vault, and saw nurse load her back again. Q. How long might she have been there? M. Tharp. I believe about 5 or 10 minutes, I can't say justly: when she was come from the vault the sister examined her, and said she believed there was something the matter; the prisoner said, No, nothing at all: then a midwife was sent for; she bid her turn on one side, and she brought away the other part: in the night I ask'd her if she knew where the child was; she said it slip'd from her as she sat on the vaults: I ask'd her if she knew the father of it; she said, he was a journeyman shoemaker that lived in a court by her master, and that she did not know she was so near her time; I never saw the child: there is but one bed betwixt mine and the vault; I was on my bed, I never heard a child cry, or a groan. Martha Clark . I went to the prisoner's bedside the 28th of October, about a quarter of an hour before this happened; I asked her how she did, she complained of a pain in her bowels; presently after I saw the nurse leading her from the vault to the bedside; the sister sent for a midwife. Q. How near was you to the vault when she was there? M. Clark. About ten or a dozen yards, I was sitting by the fire, the vault is only separated from the room by a wooden partition. Q. Did you hear a child cry while she was there? M. Clark. No, I did not. Q. to S. Gillis. How near was you to the vault while the prisoner was there? S. Gillis. I was sitting by the fire eating my supper; the fire is not so far from the vault as ten yards; I never heard a child cry; if there had been any noise there we must have heard it. M. Evans. I was to-and-fro, I heard no noise at all, and when I went to the vault to her I heard no noise nor no groan. Elizabeth Chambers . I asked her one day if she was with child; she said no, no more than I: this was before she was in the hospital, about the latter end of June last. William Clutherburg . I am porter in the hospital, I was present at the opening the vault, some of the soil was ordered to be taken away, it was three nights work before the child was found; in the night between Sunday and Monday, about half an hour after two o'clock, I saw the child taken out, it was a male child, I thought it a full grown child, I saw no marks of violence upon it. Q. Did you observe the navel-string, whether cut or otherwise? Clutherburg. No, I did not. Robert Young . I am one or the surgeons belonging to the Hospital, the woman was my patient there for a sore leg; she had another complaint, for which she was under the doctor's care, that was a complaint in her bowels: I had not the least suspicion of her being with child. I was directed to observe the body of the infant on the Tuesday, it appeared to be perfect and full grown, there did not appear to me any external marks of any injury having been done to the child: I opened the thorax, and took out the lungs, in order to make the experiment usually made in these cases, that is putting them into water; I did, the lungs did swim, but I was of opinion that that experiment cannot be conclusive in this case, because the body had laid 3 days in the bog house, and I think such a fermentation might have been brought off, that it might gather air. Q. to the midwife. Is it possible the prisoner could be delivered sitting on the vault involuntarily? Midwife. It is. I imagine from what I saw upon her hands, that might come in endeavouring to bring that part which I brought away. Q. to Mr. Young. Did you make any observation on the child, as to the navel string, that might read you to think it might drop from her? Young. The navel string did not appear to be cut. Prisoner's Defence. When I was upon the vault a pain came upon me. and I could not get off, nor I did not know where I was till I was in bed. I was quite insensible when the child came from me; and as soon as the midwife came, I told her the child was down in the vault. For the Prisoner. Sarah Rhodes . I found this baby linnen in the prisoner's box, since she was in prison. She sent to me to go and get her cloaths from her master's where she lived servant. Q. How long was that after she had been in prison? Sarah Rhodes . This was about a fortnight after she was committed. Here are 2 caps, at waistcoat, sarchead cloth, a biggin, and every thing for a child except a shirt. (Produced in court) I always thought her a sober quiet girl. Elz. Riddle deposed she saw the things taken out of the prisoner's box. Mary Evans , Ann Harrison , and Elizabeth Short , gave her the character of a sober honest servant. Acquitted ."
1723-02-27,,1.0,,"33. (L.) Isabella Buckham spinster , was indicted for the murder of her male bastard child . She like wise stood charged on the coroner's inquest for the midmurder. Nov. 22 . ++ Ann Smith . I am nurse in Faith's ward, Bartholomew's hospital . The prisoner was a patient there. I was sitting by the fire, she called to me to burg her the bed pan; she was then ill in bed, I did not know she was with child before; she had a loose stool in the pan, I took and emptied it. I went to the fire and heard her puking, I went and held the bed pan to her, and she pulled in it; I went and emptied it again, and put it by her bedside, and went to the fire side again. After that she called me to warm her a flannel petticoat to put round her waist, she desired me to pin it round her waist; told her I could not for fear of pricking her, and she did it on herself. I went and sat by the fire again; Molly Elger called to Peggy Bland , and said, do you not hear a child cry? Peggy said, yes, I do; the prisoner said, I hear one cry myself. Q. When was this? A. Smith. On the 20th of Nov. betwixt one and two o'clock. Some time after this the prisoner said, nurse, my sheets are all wet; I turned the cloaths down, and found the sheets all as they are when a woman has had a child. I said, God bless me, here has been a child; she said, nurse do not say such a thing, for I never had a child in my life. She bid me put the sheets out and have them wash'd, and she would pay for them. I took them to M. Elger, and said, look here, she says she never had a child; I said, where the child is I do not know. Then my sister, Mary Steward , told her, you have had a child, pray where is it, and sent for a midwife; she came and cleared her of the after burthen, I carried the bason to put it in. After that her white flannel petticoat was taken out of the bed, and we saw the print of the child in it where it had laid. After sometime she said, the man that drove the stage coach to Bethnal-green was the man, (but did not say he was her husband, or the child's father) and there are none but you (to me) and the people in the ward can save me. Q. Did you ever see the child afterwards? Ann Smith . I saw a child afterwards in the dead house in the coffin, but I will not swear that was the child. Cross examination. Q. Have you been mother of children? Ann Smith . Yes I have. Q. Have not people been in the same condition in miscarriages ? Ann Smith . Yes, they have. I don't say that was her child. Q. Did you see any childbed linen among her things ? Ann Smith . I never looked among her things? Mary Elger . I was a patient in the ward at the time. On Thursday the 20th of November between the hours of one and two in the morning, I heard a child cry. Q. From whence did it come? Elger. From some part of the ward. Q. Did it come from where the prisoner lay? Elger. I can't say that. I got up right in my bed, and said to Margaret Bland , Lord Peggy, don't you hear a child cry? she answered, and said, yes; and the prisoner said, Lord! Polly, so do I hear it. Q. Did you ever see this child afterwards? Elger. Yes, I saw it in the taking in room, when the coroner sat on it; I had seen it first in the dead house. Q. How far was you from the prisoner? Elger. About the distance of 6 or 7 yards. Cross Examination. Q. Can you take upon you to say it was the prisoner's child? Elger. I would not say so for the world. Q. Did not some of the people say they heard some young kittens cry the night before? Elger. Some of them did. Margaret Bland . On the 20th of Nov. at half an hour-after one, I sat upon my bed a coughing, and I heard a cry of a child; and Mary Elger called to me, and said, Peggy Bland , did not you hear a child cry? I said, yes, I did. Then the prisoner said to Mary Elger , Lord, Polly, I think I hear a child cry too. I laid myself down and heard no more. Mary Lewis . I sent for the midwife, and saw the after burthen taken from the prisoner; and I saw tracks, all bloody, from the bed to the necessary house, but I saw no child till I saw one in the dead house; but I can't swear it to be the prisoner's. Q. Did you see the prisoner go to the necessary house ? Lewis. No, I did not. I saw a great deal of blood and matter on the sheets that were taken off her bed, and a round mark in the petticoat as if a child had been there. Q. Did you see the sheets taken off the bed ? Lewis. No, I did not. Q. Did you see the petticoat taken out of the bed ? Lewis. No, I did not. Q. What time did you see this blood on the sheets? Lewis. About five in the morning. Cross examination. Q. Had you any talk with the prisoner at the bar ? Lewis. I asked her where was her child? she said she had never a one. Q. Did she appear to be in her senses? Lewis. I can't tell, for I was almost out of mine. Q. to Ann Smith. Did the prisoner appear to be in or out of her senses at the time? Ann Smith . I am not able to say which? Mary Old . I was in the hospital at the time; I lay in the next bed to the prisoner I heard her very ill in the night, she groaned violently; I heard her get out of the bed to go to the vault twice, and come in again; I opened my curtain and saw her go to it, and shut the door afterwards. I saw the sheets taken off the bed afterwards; they were like a lying-in woman's sheets. I saw the flannel petticoat taken out of the bed; that was bloody. Q. What hour was it you heard her groan first? Old. It was very early in the morning; she awaked me out of my sleep, but I don't know the hour. Q. Did you hear a child cry? Old. No, I did not. Cross examination. Q. If a child had cry'd in the next bed to you, should you have heard it as soon as the groans of a woman. Old. I can't say for that. Q. Have you not known people in that extreme pain they are in at such a time, to be put out of their senses? Old. I can't say I ever knew such a thing, it may be. Q. Did you hear the other women say that they heard a child cry? Old. I did not hear them say so then, but I heard them say so afterwards. Q. to Ann Smith . How often did you hear the child cry ? Ann Smith . I heard but one shriek. Ann Wing . I was in the same ward with the prisoner; I saw her get out of the bed, and saw her turning from the feet of the bed, going into the vault between one and two in the morning; I did not see her come back again. I saw the sheets taken off the bed, they were very bloody, and so was the prisoner. I saw the flannel petticoat lying on the floor. There were clots of blood fell on the floor, which shook out of the sheets as they were taken out of the bed; there were all the symptoms of her having been delivered of a child. I did not see the child till it was in the hall; it was a fine boy. Cross examination. Q. Would not she have been in the same condition had she miscarried? Wing. She might. William Clutterburg . I belong to Bartholomew's hospital. There was a report there had been a child born in the ward where the prisoner lay, and the treasurer gave orders the vault should be searched. There was a piece of heavy iron fixed to a rope and let down; it stopped after it was gone a little way down, but by raising the iron and letting it down several times, the passage was opened; then we went to search the sespool; this vault vented itself on the left side; I ordered them to search, and soon a fine male child was taken out. I observed a wound on the side of the head, which I imagined was given by the iron instrument that was let down. It seemed to be a full grown child. Q. Had it nails on its fingers? Clutterburg. I think it had; and hair. It was as fine a child as ever I saw. It appeared to have been fresh thrown in. Prisoner's defence. I was not in my senses; I do not know what I said or did. Had I been in my senses I should have been very loth to have parted with it. To her character. Mr. Avery. The prisoner lived servant with me two years and three months; she believed modest, sober, honest and careful; I never heard her spell an ill word. Q. When did she come to live with you? Mr. Avery. She came the 4th or 5th of September was two year, and she imagined she had a dropsy, and went from my house to the hospital. Acquitted ."
1723-02-27,,1.0,,"235. (L.) Mary Mussen , spinster , was indicted for the murder of her female bastard child, by cutting its throat , April 29 . She stood likewise charg'd on the coroner's inquest for the said murder. Mr. Phipps. Although I am prosecutor in this trial, I can give but little light into it. I can only inform the court I did suspect the prisoner to be with child, and very strictly charged her with it. Q. What was she? Phipps. She was my servant . Q. Can you tell the time you charged her with being with child? Phipps. I can't exactly tell the time. I believe it might be about two months before she was brought to bed. Q. What was her answer? Phipps. She very boldly denied it, and assur'd me with great truth and veracity it was a very unjust censure; she shew'd no signs of guilt at all. She answer'd in such a manner that I was really a good deal inclined to think she was innocent. Q. Did she appear big? Phipps. She did, which was the cause of suspicion. She told me it was a distemper, and was inclinable to think it was the dropsy. Q. Was it very visible? Phipps. It was. She never in the least strove to conceal that, which rather confirm'd me in the belief of her innocence. I told her if that was the case, she was an object of pity and compassion, and I would get her to be an out patient in the hospital. I thought that to discharge her my service would be of hurt to her, rather than alleviate her case (as there are undeniable cases where women may have the appearance of being with child, when really they are not so) so I continued her in my service till it came to this unhappy issue. I did not see the child nor her after she was delivered. Here are witnesses that can inform the court as to the particulars of it. So I shall beg leave to refer your lordship to their examination. Q. Do you know that she had taken any thing by way of medicine? Phipps. She told me she was under the care of some person (whom I forget) and had taken a very strong dose of medicine. Q. When did she tell you this? Phipps. The preceding night of her being brought to bed. Cross Examination. Q. How long had she liv'd with you? Phipps. I believe she liv'd with me about eight months. Q. How was her behaviour that time? Phipps. Her behaviour was nothing amiss, and to the last went about the house very chearful and merry, and I really thought it had been a distemper. Mary Short . I am servant to Mr. Phipps. On the over night that the prisoner was brought to bed, she told me she had taken physic. Q. Did you see her take it? A. No, I did not; when I went to see her in the morning she told me she had been very ill of the cholic. Q. How long had she been in the house? A. About eight months. Q. How long have you been there? A. I have been there longer. Q. What morning was this you speak of? A. This was on the 29th of April. I ask'd her how she was then, she said she was very ill, but said she was a great deal easier than she had been. Q. What time of the day was this? A. This was about ten o'clock. I ask'd her if she would please to have any thing, she said no. I went down and brought her up some broth; she eat them, and said she was a good deal easier and better, and beg'd she might lie down and go to sleep. Q. Was she up at that time? A. No, she was in bed then. I went down, and after that went to her again, and said I thought she seemed very ill, and if she would have body of her acquaintance to come I would send for them. Q. What time was this? A. This was about half an hour after ten o'clock; her answer was she was better, and she chose to lie still, and did not want any body. I went away from her, and went again in less than half an hour. Q. Did she and you lie together? A. No, we did not. Q. What did she say then ? A. She said she was a great deal better, and desir'd she might not be disturb'd, for she was going to sleep. I left her, and after that she had some water gruel, and still desir'd to be alone by herself, and said she thought she should go to sleep. Q. Did you ever suspect she was with child ? A. I did, and have often charged her with being with child, but she never would own it. Q. How often have you charged her? A. A great many times. She said she was no more with child than I was, and if she was, the D - l got it, for she never knew a man. From her answers she made me, I did believe it was a distemper, as she so stedsastly denied it; that afternoon she had some wine. Q. What time was that? A. It was between three and four o'clock. I never left her alone all day long, but was backwards and forwards; when I gave her the wine I perceived she was in a great deal of pain, I ask'd her if she would have any more, she said no, she had rather be left alone than to be troubled so. I was with her till the midwife came. Q. Did you know she was sent for? A. No, I did not. Q. What time was it when she came? A. I believe it was between 7 and 8 in the evening. Q. After she came what did you observe? A. I was sent for something that was wanting, and was not in the room when the midwife found the child. Q. What did you see when you return'd ? A. When I came again I saw a child lying on the table with its throat cut. Q. Describe the cut. A. It seem'd to be two inches long, crossway, directly in the middle of the throat. Q. How deep did it seem to be? A. I can't particularly tell that. Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing? A. I heard her say she did not know how that happen'd, for she did not go to do it. Q. Did you observe any thing else? A. I observed a great quantity of blood wrap'd up in a colour'd apron. Q. Was the body warm or cold? A. I was so frighted I could not observe any thing as to that. Q. Did you observe any thing besides blood in the colour'd apron? A. I observed the stool of a new-born infant there; it was wrap'd up with the child. Q. Did you observe any more blood than what you speak of? A. I observed blood in the bed, and I saw likewise more about the bed-side, on the bed, not on the floor. Q. What quantity? A. I really can't tell what quantity, there was a great deal. Cross Examination. Q. How did she behave during the time she lived fellow servant with you? A. She always behaved well. Q. Did you or did you not believe she was with child? A. I did not believe she was. Q. Did she appear like a person that had been in great torture ? A. Not then; she told me she was much easier than she had been. Q. How then did she appear? A. Not as a person in great torture. Q. When you carried her up some wine, and found her in pain, about three or four o'clock, how long did you stay with her? A. I staid with her till the midwife came. Q. Did you think her with child then? A. No, I did not. Q. Why so? A. Because she had so stiffly denied it to me. I was backwards and forwards all day long. Q. What were the times you were with her ? A. I was with her at ten, at eleven, between twelve and one, and when I came from dinner, which was about half an hour after three; it was at that time I went up and gave her some wine and a bit of bread. Q. How long was it at the most you was absent from her at any one time that day? A. There was about half an hour's space between the times of my going to her. Q. Was you commonly in the room with her, or what you call backwards and forwards? A. I was backwards and forwards with her, she was not left alone any length of time. Q. When was the child born? A. I don't know that. Mrs. Ann Farrer . I was sent for to Mr. Phipps's, and when I came there was told they had a suspicion that the prisoner was with child. Q. What time of the day was it that you went? A. I believe it was about eight at night; I was desired by Mrs. Phipps to go up- stairs, but not to let her know who I was, or what I came about. I went up and told her I came from her friends ow how she did; she told me she was be than what she had been, but she had had the cholick a great many hours, and on asking of her several questions I had reason to believe that a child was born, upon which I acquainted Mrs. Phipps with my suspicion who desired I would insist upon knowing where the child was laid. Q. What did you upon that ? A. I told her I found she was suspected in the house for being with child, and I apprehended she would make no scruple in letting the family know whether she was or not; she said she was not. I told her she had been delivered of a child. Q. What answer did she make to that? A. I told her I was very well assured there had been a child born. She said, how could I prove that? I said from many circumstances, and your master and his lady are in the other room with an officer, who will come in and take you into custody if you will not confess it, and where it is laid; then, after a great many hesitations; she told me it was under the bolster, where I look'd and found it. Q. In what condition did you find it? A. The throat was cut, and it was wrap'd up in a colour'd apron. Q. Was it a large or small wound? A. There was a large wound cross the throat, as to the length I can't be particular. Q. Did you observe, according to your judgment, whether the child had been dead long or not? A. I believe not. Q. Why do you believe not? A. The stomach was warm, and I observ'd two or three drops of blood issue from the throat, after it was laid upon the table. Q. How were the limbs, was there any warmth there? A. I believe not. Q. Did you observe any quantity of blood? A. I can't be a judge as to the quantity, the apron was full; there was a great deal. Q. Did you observe any thing else upon the apron? A. I observed a stool there. Q. From what you observ'd, can you form any judgment whether the child was born alive or not. A. I rather think it was than it was not. Q. Don't you recollect something from that stool being upon the apron? A. Yes. Q. Did ever a child that was born dead make a stool to your knowledge? A. I think not. Q. Did you observe whether it was a perfect child? A. It was at its full time. Q. Did you observe any blood upon the bed? A. Yes; there was a large quantity. Q. Could you form any judgment how long the child had been dead? A. The limbs seem'd as if they had been cram'd together. Q. How, and in what manner? A. One leg seem'd to be drawn up backwards. Q. Can you form any judgment with what instrument this incision was made? A. I asked her where the knife was. She said it was in the chair by her. Q. Did you find it there? A. Yes, I did, as she directed. (Produced in court; the court and jury look at it, and find blood dried on it.) Cross Examination. Q. Have you been a midwife a great while? A. I have. Q. Have you sufficient knowledge to know this; supposing a child is strangled, or otherwise killed just at the time it is born, so that it does not come alive from the woman, can you distinguish whether it can have a stool, supposing life just departed from it? A. I think it impossible. Q. When life is going by violence from any person, do you know or not, whether those persons have evacuations at the mouth, or otherwise? A. We have often instances in that at the mouth, but I can't say I ever met with it in this kind. Q. Whether that blood that was in the bed was in that part of the bed where the prisoner lay? A. It was. Q. Do you apprehend that issued from the child? A. No, I do not; but it was the consequence of another cause. Council. You say one of the child's legs was a little drawn up. A. Yes, it was. Q. Is it customary of a child, if there should be a hard birth, to be distorted in its birth? A. They are generally contracted, but where there is life we put them strait; a child is generally drawn a little. Q. Have you seen women in great torture of a hard birth; is it not such as would make her glad of every opportunity to relieve herself from that torture? A. To be sure it would. Council. You say you ask'd her where the knife was, with which she made the wound, and she said it lay in the chair by the bedside; what was her answer to the next question ? A. I asked her how she could be so cruel. She said, she did not intend to murder it. Q. Supposing you had had no directions at all of the prisoner, might not you have found the knife by the bedside? A. I imagine I should. Q. Was there any thing upon the chair besides the knife? A. I can't take upon me to say there was, but I was very much surprised. Q. In the delivery of this child, might it not be necessary to make use of some sort of an instrument? A. Yes. Q. In what manner? A. To part the child. Q. Must that instrument be applied to the child's throat? A. No. Q. There is something to be cut, is there not? A. There is. Q. Supposing the child in the delivery was to be very difficult in coming from the mother, and the mother should attempt to cut the navel-string, might not she cut the throat through mistake? A. I can't say any thing to that; I never met with any instance of that sort. Q. Have not children sometimes their navel-strings wrap'd round their necks in their birth? A. Very often; the umbilical vein was cut within an inch and a half, or two inches of the body. John James . I was desired to examine the child, to determine whether it was born alive or dead if I could; I found it lying at it's full length upon a table. Q. Did it appear to you to have been born perfect? A. It did, in all its parts, and at it's full time. I f ound a large wound extended cross the neck. Q. How long might that wound be? A. From skin to skin it might be about three inches in length; it had divided the wind-pipe entirely, and all the blood vessels on each side the wind-pipe, both veins and arteries. I thought I observed that blood had been forced from the wound backwards, there was the trace of fresh blood in the nose, and the child had been washed very clean. Q. What did you collect from seeing fresh blood there? A. From that I collected that the child was born alive, for I imagine the blood by the breath had been forced up into the nose thro' the wind-pipe; this was an argument with me to induce me to believe it, for no dead body breathes. I then open'd the body, and examin'd the state of the lungs, and found they had been inflated, there had wind passed into the lungs; the nature of the lungs is, when the animal has been alive and air has passed into them, that they will float in water; any animal that has never been alive, and breath has never passed into the lungs, they will sink in water. This is a positive proof to know that the child had been alive. From this circumstance I did conclude that the child had been alive, and gave it in as my judgment. Q. Could you form any judgment how long the child had been alive? A. No, I could not. Q. Do you take it that the lungs were as much inflated as if the child had breathed for for a considerable time? A. I don't determine that, the lungs may inlarge by the continual admission of air; they may extend themselves. Q. Supposing the child strangled in its birth, with its head foremost, as soon as the mouth is exposed to the air, might it not be said the lungs are in some degree inflated? A. I can't take upon me to determine that. In such cases it is the strongest proof we can arrive at, by trying the lungs in water, to know whether the child has or has not breathed. Q. Did you see the apron afterwards? A. I did. Q. Did you see the stool? A. I did, but can't pretend to say any thing in relation to that; that is not what I was call'd to determine. Cross Examination. Council. Then the moment the air gets into the lungs they become inflated; can you see any reason why a child that has got it's head in the air, and afterwards dies in the birth, why that child's lungs should not be inflated, because inflation must go in at the mouth? A. I can't determine how far that may or may not be the case, because I have not examin'd it so critically. Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of what is laid to my charge. I did not know what I did at that time. For the Prisoner. Mr. Shaw. I have been in the midwisry and surgery way many years. I have known more instances than one, that children have had stools and urine where they have died in the birth. Q. Supposing a woman in great agony in labour should attempt to cut the navel string, might not she cut the child's throat? A. I can't say as to that. Q. Have you known navel strings wrap'd round the child's neck? A. I have known that very often. I was once call'd upon such an occasion, and I found a piece of the navel string left in the kitchen, cut in two different places. John Mussen . The prisoner is my daughter. I carry'd her a bottle of hiera picra, on the Wednesday before this accident happen'd. Q. How came you to carry that? A. She had complain'd to her mother that she had got the dropsy, so my wife desired me to carry it to her. Margaret Cook . I have known the prisoner very well these eighteen or nineteen years. Q. What has her behaviour been? A. She was always a very civil quiet girl, extremely sober and honest. Q. Was she of a tender or a cruel disposition towards children? A. Nobody was more tender of children, she has been so to mine? Q. What is her general character? A. She had always a good character till this time. Elizabeth Cofield . I have known the prisoner nineteen years, or almost from her birth; when she was a child, she was under my care. Q. What is her general character? A. She always was a very sober and modest girl. Q. How was her disposition towards children, tender or cruel? A. I never perceived but that she was a tender mild girl, and never heard of any blemish in her character till this time. Sarah Spradbrough . I have known the prisoner ten or twelve years. Q. What is her general character? A. She was a very sober modest girl, as far as ever I heard. Q. What was her disposition towards children? A. She was a very meek girl, universally good till this accident happen'd. Mrs. Hines. I have known her ever since she was fourteen years of age. Q. How long is it ago since you first knew her? A. That is about thirteen years ago. Q. What is her general character? A. I never heard any thing amiss of her till this time. Q. Was she tender or cruel towards children? A. She was remarkable for tenderness to children; she used to dress out all the children in the town where she was born, and would give them any thing. Mrs. York. I have known her eighteen years. Q. What has been her behaviour and character? A. She was always reckon'd a very sober virtuous young woman. Q. Was she tender of children? A. She was extremely tender of children. I lived in the house with her mother, and could not have believed any such thing of her, or that she could be capable of doing what is laid to her charge. Mary Edwards . I have known her about twelve years. Q. What is her general character? A. A very sober honest girl as any I know. Her character was generally good. Q. Was she humane or tender, or what? A. She was a very tender girl, and fond of children; she used to take the neighbours children about with her as if they were her own. Mr. Wells. I have known her ever since she was born. I served my time next door to her father's house. Q. What was her general character ? A. She was always a very modest girl, I never heard the least word amiss of her till now. Q. Was she humane or cruel to children? A. She was always good-natur'd and always counted so. Charles Harding . I have known her twenty four years. Q. What is her general character? A. She always had an extream good character; a tender, sober, honest girl. Q. With regard to her tenderness to children, how was she? A. She always seemed very tender to children, she loved to play in the street with them. William Rogers . I have known her ever since her birth almost; her father and I were fellow apprentices together. Q. What is her general character? A. A modest sober well behaved girl; I never heard any thing to the contrary in my life time. Q. How did she behave towards children? A. As to children I cannot give any account, because I was very seldom at Highgate, where she lived. Guilty , Death . This being Friday, she received sentence immediately after the verdict given to be executed the Monday following, and to be dissected and anatomiz'd, and was executed accordingly ."

On the 15th of Nov. as soon as I got up in the morning, my wife said these words to me, She has thrown the child into the vault; my man was by, I said, Go and see if you can get the child out; he goes with a pair of tongs and a candle, (this was about 8 o'clock) he said he had got hold of it and it slipped away, and he could not come at it. I went and acquainted the nightman with it; he sent his men, one of them put his head down very low, and said he saw it; he directed one of the men to dig some mould away, and take away a plank, there lay the child; I saw it taken out; I saw a wound at the corner of the child's mouth, quite down towards the jaw, it seemed to go quite through, about an inch long; the man put it into a tub of water, and washed it, then it was laid on a table: it was a male child. Rose Hall. The prisoner was my servant. On Monday morning, about 7 o'clock, the 15th of Nov. I came out of my room, I was surprized seeing a great deal of blood upon the stairs a 2 pair of stairs that led to the prisoner's room, I went into the room, and said, Molly, how do you do? (she was then in bed, she had been not well over night, she said she believed she had got the cholick) she answered, Very bad, I believe I shall die. I said, I believe you are very bad indeed, I having seen blood from her room down into the yard. I looked round the room, and under the bed, and saw nothing: I said I believe I must go and fetch somebody: I went and fetched Mrs. Bickeridge, a midwife, she told the prisoner there had been a child born of the prisoner answered, There was a lump of something came from her; the midwife asked her what she had done with it; she said, she had put it down the vault. I lighted a candle, and looked down, and saw a child; then we bid a servant man, the man she lays it to, to go and get it out with a pair of tongs; it slipped away; after that it was taken out, and washed, and laid on a table, and Mr. Goodman and Mr. White came, I believe the forepart of that same day, and saw it. Q. Did you examine the woman, to know whether there had been a child born? Rose Hall. No; Dr. White did, he his here; the prisoner had been complaining she was very ill, we took a great deal of pity on her, she complained of a dropsy; I hired people to do her business for her. Q. Did she say any thing about a child being till after the child was found? Rose Hall. No, she did not: then she said it dead, and she knew nothing of it till it dropt down on the boards, as she was sitting by her bed side, and she perceived no life in it. Q. her cross examination, she said, the prisoner was a good servant, and behaved well; that she was a very clean body, and she did look upon her character as undeniable: that she took the prisoner's key, and looked in her box, and there found some things proper for a child. She produced a gown, caps, blankets, and several things. (Produced in Court.) George White . I am a man-midwife. I was sent for to Mr. Hall's on the 15th of Nov. about 11 o'clock, to attend on a suspicion of murder. I was surprized, and sent for my friend Mr. Goodman, to go along with me We both went into the room to the child; I took a cursory view of the child, then being desired to go up to the poor creature, I found she had been newly delivered of a child, and I was obliged to do the requisites to the same. After which we went down stairs and examined the child; we found a wound on the right side of the jaw, and the jaw-bone broke on the same side. Q. What sort of a wound was it? White. It was a laceration, a tearing by force on the right side of the mouth, beginning at the mouth and extending almost to the ear. Q. Was the child full grown? White. It was a perfect full grown child, at its full time, a male infant. Q. By the appearance of this wound can you account how it might come? White. The poor creature, I doubt not, was in a great deal of distress, when the child's head might be born, and to extricate herself in that misery, she might introduce her fingers into the child's mouth, she might make use of this means to pull the child from her, which might break the jaw and tear the part. This I mention from my own observation and experience. I believe the child was still- born. Q. What is your reason for that? White. From the difficulty of the birth, and the ceration of herself. It is plain to me, no person would give themselves pain, if they could help or ease it; every body will try to ease themselves; and as the navel-string was broke before, death trust ensue before the child could be delivered. The lungs may be filled with air, and the child not been alive. I was present when the child was opened, and an experiment made upon the lungs swam upon the surface. Q. Is not that a circumstance to prove the child was born alive? White. It may be in some cases. but we have proof to the contrary. I was sent for, last Thursday was sennight, on the like occasion; there was another of the faculty that agreed with me in it. The lungs being inflated, and swimming, is not always a proof of a child's being born alive; that I have had a proof of within these ten days. Thomas Goodman . I was along with Mr. White. There was a laceration on the cheek, and the jaw broke, as he has mentioned. The lungs may be inflated, and the child be born dead. I saw the experiment made on the lungs, and they swam. I apprehend, the child's head was born first, and it might be obstructed in the passage of the vagina, probably the woman put her fingers to the child's mouth, and her thumb on the outward part, and in endeavouring to separate the child from her, the jaw might give way, and without great force, so slender a subject as an infant is, that laceration might happen. Q. Is it your opinion, the child was born dead or alive? Goodman. In consideration of the difficulty of the labour, I apprehend it was born dead. John Chatress . I am son-in-law to Mr. Hall. I do not usually lie there, but I happened accidentally to be there that night. All I know of the affair is this, There was only a small partition that intervened between my room and the prisoner's. That whole night I was exceeding restless through a disorder settled in my thigh; I heard her groan several times very distinctly, as a person in great distress. I was awake when the servant-man arose, about 4 o'clock, he went into her apartment, and according as the circumstance appeared afterwards, she was delivered a little after that time, so that if the child had been born alive, and had cryed, I don't question but I should have heard it. On his cross examination he said, It was a very thin partition, through which he could hear a person whisper, if such had been in her room; that he heard nothing but her groanings. Prisoner's Defence. When my mistress came up to me, I told her where I had put the child; it was born dead; I had no intention to destroy it, had it been born alive, for I had provided for it. Q. to Mrs. Hall. What was her character? Mrs. Hall. She bore a very good character while she lived with me. Q. How was her behaviour towards children, as to cruelty or otherwise? Mrs. Hall. I never saw any cruelty by her in the least. Ann Cook . I am very often at Mr. Hall's, I have three children, they have been with me there, the prisoner used to take a deal of notice of them. Acquitted ."
1725-02-24,,1.0,1.0,"251. + Ann Terry , of St. Giles's in the Fields , in the County of Middlesex , single woman, was indicted for that she on the 24th of April, in the 17th year of his present Majesty , being big with a female child, on the said 24th day of April, &c. she the said Ann Terry , the said female child by the providence of God from her body did bring forth alive, which said female child being so brought forth alive, by the laws of this land is a bastard; and that she the said Ann Terry , not having God before her eyes, &c. on the said 24th day of April, &c. after the said female bastard child was born, upon the said female bastard child being then alive in the peace of God, &c. feloniously, wilfully, and of her malice aforethought, did make an assault, and the said female bastard child feloniously, wilfully, and of her malice aforethought, in both her hands did take, and the said female bastard child with both her hands, out of a certain window in a lodging room belonging to the said Ann Terry three stories high, in a dwelling-house belonging to Esther Bird , Widow, in a place called Whetstone Park , into a paved yard, did cast and throw down, by which casting and throwing down into the said paved yard, she the said Ann Terry the said female bastard child several mortal wounds and bruises upon the head, back, belly, and sides, did give, of which said mortal wounds and bruises upon the head, back, belly, and sides, of the said female bastard child, the said female bastard child instantly died; and therefore the Jurors do say, that she the said Ann Terry , the said female bastard child, feloniously, wilfully, and of her malice aforethought, did kill and murder, &c. She was a second time indicted on the Coroner's Inquest for the same murder. Mary Ditcher . On the 23d of April I happened to be abroad, and when I came home I was told the Prisoner was in a violent fit of the colic; I said, Nanny, you being something in years may have some disorder. She had a Miss a little before Christmas. I sent her some penny-royal water, and when I came up again I saw some further disorder, but no appearance of the birth of a child. I asked her what ailed her. [The witness expressed herself so as to show the nature of the Prisoner's disorder.] I sent for her aunt, and gave her that which was proper. In the morning the child was found in the yard. Her aunt came to me, and said, Mrs. Ditcher, Nanny has thrown it out. Said I, what has she thrown out? Why, a child, said she. Said I, you frighten me to death. I said, oh Nanny! how could you be so barbarous as to throw it out? Said she, Mrs. Ditcher, I did it to hide my shame, and for fear you should see it. I asked her, whether the child was alive when it was born, and she said it was not. I did not see it till next morning. John Phillips . Between five and six the 24th of April in the morning as I was going to my work, I saw a dead child lye upon the pavement in the yard upon it's back, so I went and alarmed the people of the house where the Prisoner lives - I live on the ground floor in the same house. Q. Did you make any observation upon the child? Phillips. No more than to see that it was a child. Ann Tanner . On the 24th of April I was called to the Prisoner at the bar. I found she had been delivered of a child. [She said she performed the business of a midwife.] I asked her how she could do such a barbarous action as to throw her child out of the window? She said she did it to hide her shame. Whether the child that was found was the child she was delivered of, I cannot tell. Q. Did you see the child? Tanner. Yes - it was a female child. Q. Did you observe whether the child was born alive or dead? Tanner. I cannot judge whether it was or not. Edward Kelleck . I was called by the Coroner in order to examine this child, and upon examination of the child, I found it in the first place entirely free from all cleansing, but naturally as it came from the body. Upon examination, after they had cleansed it, I found there was a large contusion on the left cheek by the Os Temporum, there was a confraction of that and the jaw bone. I opened the Thorax to make an experiment upon the lungs, and some part of the lungs would swim, and some would not: she tore it away I suppose from her body. I saw upon opening the lungs that part of them were a little inflated, and would swim; this is a common experiment upon this subject, but by the tearing it away from her body, there was not time to inslate the lungs, and make them hollow. The child was blackish, which shows it was in a fluid slate while it was in the mother's body; but whether it had breathe or no after it came out of the body, I cannot pretend to say. Q. What is your general observation in cases of this nature? Kelleck. There is no role without an exception, sometimes, they may breathe before they come really into the world; I have tried that experiment many a time, but I cannot be downright certain and positive of it; but if you take an infant out of a woman's body (before it breathes) these lungs will never swim. Suppose a woman was six or seven months gone with child, and the child was dead within her, those lungs will never swim; but as children come forward in the birth, they may breathe before they are really born. Q. If a child is still-born, and dies before the delivery, the lungs will never swim; but if a child should die in the delivery, will they swim? Kelleck. It is possible they may, but I believe she was so hasty in the birth, that I apprehend she did not give time to let it breathe. Q. If the child had any respiration, would not the whole lungs be inflated with the first respiration? Kelleck. No; there must be several respirations before the whole lungs come to be inflated. Q. Now as to the contraction or expansion of the lungs, I would ask you, whether, if the actual respiration from which the blood circulates is performed for three or four seconds, all the lungs are not expanded? Kelleck. No; I believe not in so short a space. Q. Now in the case of a still-born child, will part of the lungs swim, and part sink? Kelleck. There have been experiments both ways. Q. Suppose a child is suffocated in the delivery, in that case does it occur to you, that part of those lungs have swam, and part have sunk? Kelleck. Sometimes they have partly done so, and partly not, that is to say, if it was suffocated in the birth. Thomas Noakes . The prisoner is a very quiet honest woman, only very foolish. She used to close upper leathers for shoes ; she has worked for my father and me upwards of six years. Elizabeth Stendrup . I have known the Prisoner thirty seven or thirty eight years, I have reputed her a very silly foolish girl, not capable of taking care of herself. I never heard any ill of her, nor nobody can say any harm of her. I believe sometimes she is not compos mentis. Q. Do you think she is capable of knowing whether she is with child, or not? Stendrup. I cannot tell what to say to that; I believe she might be so far non compos mentis as not to know the danger there might be attending the want of care. Elizabeth Eden . All I know of the Prisoner is, that she is a hard working body, and I never knew of any man that followed her. Q. Mrs. Ditcher, when you ordered her some pe royal water was she in her senses? Ditcher. I cannot tell; as to the questions I asked her, she did not answer as if she had any sense. Q. Why so? Ditcher. Because she said when she flung it out at the window it was to hide her shame; and I asked her as to the other matters that belonged to the child, and she did not know what I meant. I asked her several questions afterwards, and she answered me as if she was delirious, particularly with relation to the manner of her delivery. And I asked her who was the father of it, she hammered a good while, and at last she said it was one that was apprentice to her brother. I saw the lad she laid the child to, the morning it was found, and he said he would have taken care of it, if he had known she had been with child by him. Guilty , Death ."
1726-10-12,,1.0,,"383. + Grace Usop , otherwise Tarras , of St Leonard Shoreditch , was indicted for the murder of her female bastard child, by throwing the said child into a privy belonging to James Leger , wherein there was a great quantity of filth and excrement , by reason of which throwing, and by reason of the said filth and excrement, the said child was choaked and suffocated , of which choaking and suffocating the said female bastard child died , September 1 . And 384, 385. + James Leger , and Magdalen, otherwise Maudin Leger , his wife , were indicted for aiding, abetting, and maintaining the said Grace Usop to commit the said murder: and therefore they the said Grace Usop , James Leger , and Magdalen, otherwise Maudlin Leger, the said female bastard child, feloniously, wilfully, and of their malice aforethought, did kill and murder, &c. Eleanor Johnson . A few days before this thing was discovered, I went into Mr. Leger's house for half a pound of butter, and the Prisoner was there, and she was very bad. I asked her if no body was there but herself; she said her mistress was in the garden; presently her mistress came out of the garden in a very great flurry, and Mr. Leger himself came in in a very great flurry, and he said, Tarras, my girl, you are very bad, will you go to bed? and he said she should go to bed, and he called Maudlin to make the bed; said he, will you have the bed warmed? she said I don't care if I have: he said, Maudlin, my poor girl, is a very faithful servant, and she is very bad with them, and has strained herself with carrying coals, she wants the bed warmed. He asked what he should give her; and I said half a pint of ale with sugar and spice: and one Mrs. Lewis came in and said, Mrs. Johnson, have you heard of the murder? I said I had not; she said there was a fine boy in the vault: she put her hand down into the vault three times, and brought up nothing but soil, and the fourth time she put her hand down, she said, here's the child, and I could not think but it must be a girl, but there were some circumstances that made me think it was a boy, for the navel string hung between the boy's legs, and she thought it was a boy by that. Q. Is she married? Johnson. I don't know that she is. Q. Do you know that this girl had a child? Johnson. I heard so. Q. Then you don't know that she had a child? Johnson. I never had any thought of it. Q. Then there was a child in the house of office, and the child was dead? Johnson. Yes; the child was dead when I saw it. Mary Lewis . I have known Grace about two years. Q. Is she married? Lewis. Not that ever I heard of. Q. Do you know any thing of her having a child? Lewis. I don't know any thing of her having any. Coroner. Did she say any thing to you about the child? Lewis. On Thursday the first of September she went out for some rolls, I met her at Mrs. Johnson's house, and she said she was very ill with a pain in her bones. I went to Mr. Leger's house, and Mrs. Leger said that Tarras was very bad, so bad that she was forced to go up with a mop and a pail to clean the room: then I said to Mrs. Leger, with your leave shall I go up and see her? and she said, yes: I went up, and Tarras lay upon the bed with her clothes on: the room was wet, and I asked her who had been up to wash the room; she said her mistress had been up with a mop and pail, and cleaned it: she was very much out of order: I sat down by her, and asked her what was the matter with her: said I, have not you miscarried? said she, what makes you think so? I was backward and forward all that day, and Mrs. Leger said, how does Tarras do? I said she was very bad indeed, and that she would not be well of the months. On the ninth of this month one Bellache came and asked after Tarras; said I, what makes you ask after her? he said, if you want to know, go to the vault and satisfy yourself. I asked Mrs. Leger to let me go to her vault, and I went to the vault, and looked down, and saw something, which I took to be a child. I went to Tarras, and said, Tarras, this is your child; said she, Lord Jesus! Lord Jesus ! Molly don't say so. I came into the house, and said to Mr. Leger, there is a child in the vault; what in yours, said he? no, in yours, said I; and he went in, and there was no more said about it. I went to Mrs. Johnson's, and said there was a child in the vault, and we both went together. Coroner. Had you any talk with her afterwards whether she had a child? Lewis. She said she went to the vault, for she thought she had occasion to go there; and afterwards went into the shed, and said, sick, sick, sick; that she went up stairs, and leaned upon the window, and then she was delivered of the child; this was on the second of September. Q. When was it that the child was found? Lewis. On the ninth of September. Q. What day was it that Grace said she was delivered as she was leaning upon the window? Lewis. That was the day it was found out. Q. What day was she delivered? Lewis. She said it was on Sunday the first of September. Leger's Council. Did she say whether the child was dead, or alive, when she was delivered? Lewis. She did not say whether it was dead, or alive. Usop's Council. Was there any thing found under the bed in a box? Lewis . Yes; there was a box of child-bed linen, and Usop said she bought it in Rag Fair against she was brought to bed, unknown to any body. Dorcas Randolph. On Monday the second of September, which was Usop's birth-day, I was abroad with her, and she was very bad; and they said the child was born on the first of September, and was found in the vault on the ninth. I said to her, you have had a child, for there is a child found in the vault. I asked her if she had made any preparation for it; she said she had, and that the box was under the bed; said she, Mrs. Randolph, you are best able to stoop, put your hand under the bed, and pull it out, and I did. She said Mr. Leger had threatened her, and bid her lay it upon James, or the Baker; and then she said, must I tell a lie? and he said, ouy . Q. When was this? Randolph. On the ninth of September Mrs. Leger did own before the Justice, that the child had a bruise on the head: I said, how came the child to have a bruise on the head? she said that was nothing at all, for it was not done out of malice; and she emptied the pot with the after birth, and she pleaded ignorance, because she never had had a child; for people who have been in labour know more than those who have not. Council. When this discourse was with Tarras, was there any talk whether the child was born dead or alive ? Randolph. She said she was very bad, and her master came up and helped her in the birth, and parted one from the other, and took it in an apron, and carried it down stairs. Q. Was the child dead or alive ? Randolph. I cannot say any thing to that. Joachim Bellache . One of my shop-mates discovered the child in the vault on Friday in the afternoon, and said, Mrs. Bellache, there is something in the vault that looks like a bundle of Rags. I went down in the night to ease myself; I had a suspicion of something, so I was very curious , and put my finger into the vault , and thought it was flesh. I put my finger upon the body, and felt the ribs, and then I was afraid of what really was , and found that it was a child, but, I did not care to speak to Mr. Leger about it then: and Mary Lewis came in and said, there is a child in the vault: said I, Mr. Leger, it does not signify any thing talking, I told you before that your maid was with child, and he said she had had the ague and fever, and had taken too much bark, and it had hindered the courses; then I told him there was a child in the vault; he seemed surprized at it, and said, if it was so, he would send for an officer, and he ordered one Paul Ellis to fetch the beadle. Ann Baker , midwife. I saw a child that was taken out of the vault. Q. Was it born dead or alive? Baker. I could not judge whether it was born dead or alive. Coroner. Did the child come at the full time? Baker. It did not come at its full time, I am almost sure of it. Council. You say you could not judge whether the child was born alive, how could you know whether it was at its full time? Baker. Oh, Sir, that I am very sure of. Henry Gundy , Surgeon. I was sent for about the 13th of last month, and found a child which was very much putrified . I did not care to open the child, but found upon examining the child, that there was a violent pressure upon the skull, which if that had been given when the child was alive, must have been the occasion of its death. Coroner. Was the child full grown ? Grundy. In my opinion it was. Leger's Council. As to the pressure upon the head of the child, was that given before the child was dead. or after ? Grund. I cannot pretend to say whether the wound was given before or after . Leger's Council argued, that he could not think there was any evidence to affect Mr. Leger and his wife, and could hardly think there was any to affect the principal. That he was informed Mr. Leger has a wife of his own, and therefore very unlikely he should be guilty of the fact. And that in order to make it a murder, it must be first proved that the child was born alive. [Vide Statute 21. James I.] Eleanor Johnson called again at the desire of the Coroner. Q. What happened after you found the child in the vault ? Johnson. When I found the child in the vault, I went into the kitchen, and fell into, and said to Mrs. Leger, this is a terrible case; and she said Tarras was very bad, and that women in her care are never well of the months. I came out to Mr. Bellache, and he clapped his hand upon my belly, and said, God bless your belly, and said, I hope you will not drop it as somebody has done. Another thing I remember, I saw the child on the 10th of September, and it bled out of one of the ears, I think it was the left ear. On the Tuesday Tarras's mother and another woman were there, and they sent for me, and Mr. Leger said, Mrs. Johnson, you must go up and tell Tarras's mother to bribe the midwife, or else Tarras will be hanged. Coroner. She has not answered the question yet. I ask you what Tarras said when you went up to her? Johnson. I told her there was a fine child found in the vault, and they said it is yours: and after I had got an acknowledgment from her, that she had been with child, I said, who is the father of the child? and she said my master; and she asked where her master was, and she said, call my master up. I went down to him, and he went up to her, and she wept bitterly: they talked together in French, and I could not understand them; and when he was gone, I asked her what her master said; and she said, he says I must lay it to James, or the Baker, or else I shall be hanged. Capt. James Dalbiac . I have known Mr. Leger forty years. I never heard any thing against his character in my life; he is a man of reputation, and a sober diligent man in his business. Mr. Simon Dalbiac . I have known him forty years, and I never heard any thing against him, he always bore the character of an honest man. Mr. Ross. I have known him twenty years , he is a sober honest man, and a good natured man , and she is a sober industrious woman. Thomas Newland . Mr. Leger and his wife are both people of very good characters. Mr. Perim gave him the character of a very honest man. These gentlemen being asked , whether they thought he would be guilty of aiding and assisting in the murder of the child; they said they believed he would not. They were all acquitted of the murder, and likewise of the charge on the Coroner's Inquisition; and the Jury found that the child was still born."

Mary Hope of Milk-Street, the 5th of October , being big with a certain Male Bastard Child, the said Male Child from her Body was brought forth alive, and the said Mary Hope not having the Fear of God before her Eyes, but being moved by the Instigation of the Devil, the aforesaid Bastard so alive, feloniously, willfully, and aforethought, did make an Assault upon, and with a certain Linnen Apron, into a certain Wooden Box, feloniously and willfully, by wrapping and solding the said Linnen Apron, the said Bastard Child did put, by which it was so suffocated that it died . Q. (to William Aget .) Sir, what do you know of this Matter? Aget. The Prisoner at the Bar was my Servant . Q. Where do you live? Aget. In Milk-Street . The Prisoner at the Bar was my Servant; she had lived with me about four or five Months; and on Sunday the 5th of this Instant October she came down Stairs with her Fellow Servant in the Morning, but finding herself indisposed, went up again . Q. Was you by when she came down ? Aget. No, my Lord, I was not up. When I came down, this was the Relation her Fellow Servant gave me . Court. What her Fellow Servant told you is nothing; did you see her ? Aget. I did not see her 'till the Afternoon; but about Nine o'Clock in the Morning; I heard her cry out; so I sent her Fellow Servant up to see what ail'd her ; she brought me Word she was not well, and desir'd to be indulged to lie abed . She would not sufler her Fellow Servant to stay in the Room as little Time as possible; she bid her go about her Business, that she was better. This was what her Fellow Servant told me. My Duty call'd me to Church; when I came from that, I enquired how she did. Q. Had you no Suspicion ? Aget. Yes, Sir, that Cry gave me a Suspicion. My Servant told me she was much better, and intended to come down in the Afternoon. In the Afternoon she did come down, about Five o'Clock; I saw her do her Business, light a Fire, &c. I then desired my Wife and the Witness, the other Servant, to go up into her Room; there they saw what they thought was sufficient to convince them that there had been a Labour or something like it. Court. You did not go up into her Room? Agit . I did not then. When they came to me, they said they were very sure there was a Labour, or something like it had been in that Room. She strongly denied it. When nothing could be found in the Room they look'd in every Place where any Thing might be conceal'd: My Wife insisted upon opening her Box; she made some Difficulty and could not find the Key; upon which I told her, her Mistress should have Satisfaction , and if the Key was not be found I would break the Box open; accordingly I took her fellow Servant up with me and did break it open, and there, to my great Surprize, was a dead Child. Court. You saw it? Aget. I saw it. Q. Did you look upon the Child, was there any Marks of Violence ? Aget. I saw none. I sent for the Constable and charg'd him with her . Q. (to the Prisoner) Would you ask Mr. Aget any Questions? Prisoner. No. Q. (to Dorothy Robinson ) Was you fellow Servant with the Prisoner ? Do you live at Mr. Aget's? Robinson. Yes Sir. Court. Give an Account of what you know of the Matter. Do you remember when she cry'd out? Robinson. It was about Nine o'Clock; and I went up. Q. What Condition was she in ? Robinson. She complain'd of being very ill, but did not tell me her Distemper. Q. Had you any Suspicion of her being in Labour? Robinson. Yes, we thought so by her Screeking out, but she deny'd it, and it went over. Q. Did she desire you to go down ? Robinson. Yes Sir, she desired me to go down , and I told my Mistress, and my Mistress went up and examin'd her. Q. Was you with your Mistress then? Robinson. No Sir, I was below. Q. Was you up any more? Robinson. Yes, I went up several Times in the Day, and I ask'd her how she did; and she said she was better. Q. Did she always tell you that she was better? Robinson. Yes, 'till she came down; she said she would come down in the Afternoon . Q. What did she say when she came down ? Robinson. She said she was much better. Q. Did you go up Stairs with your Master and Mistress when the Child was found in the Box? Robinson. Yes. My Mistress told her she was sure she had a Child, and she would examine; so they broke open the Box and found the Child. Q. What was the Child, Male or Female? Robinson. Male. Q. Did the Child seem to have any Marks of Violence? Robinson. No Sir, we could not perceive any Marks of Violence about the Child. Q. Had she any Childbed Linnen ready? Robinson. We examin'd her Clothes and there was none to be found. Q. Are you skilful enough to know whether she went her full Time? Robinson. My Lord here is the Midwife. Q. (to Mary Jeyne ) Are you a Midwife? Jeyne . Yes, my Lord. Q. What do you know of this Matter? Jeyne . I was sent for on Monday was se'nnight. She was deliver'd the Sunday before; I was sent for to know if she was safely deliver'd. I did not examine her, I examin'd other Matters, and found she was safely deliver'd . Q. Did you see the Child ? Jeyne. Yes my Lord . Q. Did you see any Marks of Violence on the Child? Was it of its full Time . Jeyne. I believe it was, or very nigh, my Lord . Court. You that are a skilful Woman, do you think the Child was born dead , or came to any violent Death afterwards ? Jeyne. I saw no Marks of Violence: 'Tis impossible for any Body to say it was born alive; for want of Help in Time it might be suffocated, or another Way, thro' the Naval String, or otherwise, &c. I turn'd it before them all, and there were no Marks of Violence found . Q. Did you observe any Thing else. Jeyne. The Child look'd just like another Child that should die a natural Death. Richard Wheatland . About Eight o'Clock on Sunday Evening, the 5th Instant, Mr. Aget came to me, seemingly in a very great Fright, he said I must go along with him . Q. What are you, a Constable? Wheatland. Yes. As we were going down the Street together, he said his Maid was deliver'd of a Child, and he believ'd it was murder'd. Q. What then? Wheatland. I went up with Mr. Aget and his Wife into the Garret , where I saw the Woman sitting on the Bed, crying prodigiously; I said to her, good Woman are you married? she said yes she was. I says, what Provision have you made for the Birth of this Child? none at all said she; upon which I said to her, it was surprising to me that a married Woman should suffer herself to bring a Child into the World and have nothing to put it in; tell me the Truth I says, are you married or not? she crying still, said at last she was not; I then ask'd her again, have you nothing at all made for this Child, no Linnen whatsoever? none at all she said: I ask'd her who was the Father of the Child; she said a Sailor. I ask'd her what was become of him, she said he was gone to Sea: I afterwards saw the Child, my Lord, in this check'd Linnen Apron. Mr. Aget gave me charge to take her in a Coach to the Compter, which I did, and went with her myself, my Lord, in the Coach, which Mr. Aget paid for; I told the Deputy Keeper of the Compter to put her up warm, for she was deliver'd that Morning: She declared that the Child was born dead, that is all that I know, Acquitted ."
1727-07-05,,,1.0,"65. (M.) Elizabeth Warner , otherwise Betty , single woman , was indicted for that she, on the 28th of November , was big with a certain male child, and afterwards was privately, and secretly delivered, by the providence of God, of that child alive, which, by the laws of this land, was called a bastard, and as soon as it was born, she, feloniously, wilfully, and of malice aforethought, with both her hands, did throw into a certain necessary house, by which means she, the said male child, did kill and murder ; she likewise stood charged on the coroner's inquest for the said murder.* John Whitman. I am a nightman, and found a child in a privy belonging to Mr. Welch, in Plough-street, near Red-lion-square . Q. When? Whitman. On the 29th of November last. I remember it was on the thanksgiving day. Q. Was it a male or a female? Whitman. It was a male child. Tuncella Webb. I am a midwife, and saw this child as soon as it was cleaned, after it was taken out of the privy. Q. Was it a male or female? T. Webb. It was a boy. Q. Was it at full growth or otherwise? T. Webb. To the best of my knowledge it was at full growth. I know nothing more, only seeing the woman [meaning the prisoner] in her bed in the workhouse. Sarah Sawyer . The prisoner came in very uneasy to the alehouse where I live, that is, the Man in the Moon alehouse in Plough street, in the evening before the thanksgiving day. Q. What hour? S. Sawyer. It was not quite eight at night. I took great notice of her being so uneasy. I went away, and left her there. Q. What time did you go away? S. Sawyer. I went away presently after I took notice of her. Q. Did you return again that night? S. Sawyer. I was gone better than a quarter of an hour, and when I came again, I was told the woman was delivered of a child in the vault. Q. Did you see the child? S. Sawyer. I did, after it was taken out; there was a great uprear among the people, and they said the child was there. Q. Was it a male or female? S. Sawyer. It was a male child. I saw a great quantity of blood on the top of the window shutter belonging to that alehouse. Q. Was it within the publick house? S. Sawyer. No, it is just as you come out at the door; I helped to clean it, and after that I went up to see her. Note, The Remainder of these Proceedings will be published in a few Days. THE PROCEEDINGS ON THE King's Commissions of the Peace, Oyer and Terminer, and Gaol Delivery FOR THE CITY of LONDON, And also the Gaol Delivery for the County of MIDDLESEX, HELD AT JUSTICE-HALL in the OLD-BAILEY, On Wednesday the 16th, and Thursday the 17th of JANUARY, In the Thirty-third Year of His MAJESTY'S Reign. NUMBER II. PART II. for the YEAR 1760. Being the Second SESSIONS in the MAYORALTY of The Right Honble Sir THOMAS CHITTY , Knt. LORD-MAYOR of the CITY of LONDON. LONDON: Printed, and sold by G. KEARSLY (Successor to the late Mr. Robinson) at the Golden-Lion, in Ludgate-Street, 1760. [Price Four-pence.] THE PROCEEDINGS ON THE King's Commissions of the Peace, and Oyer and Terminer, for the City of LONDON, and at the General Sessions of Gaol Delivery of Newgate, holden for the said City of LONDON, and County of MIDDLESEX, at Justice-Hall in the Old-Bailey, &c. Q WHERE was she? S. Sawyer. She was in an empty room two or three doors beyond, sitting on a basket; I saw something lying by her wrap'd up in a cloth, which I open'd and look'd at, and after I had seen it said, it was very odd that one thing should be there, and not the other, meaning the child. Q. What answer did she make you? S. Sawyer. She made me no answer at all. Mary Lawson . I went to the Man in the Moon alehouse on the 28th of November, where I saw the prisoner at the bar. Q. At what time? M. Lawson. It was in the evening, but I can't say the hour; the prisoner was stitching the form of prayer, to have them ready to sell the next day; after that I saw her rise from her seat, seeming not to be well, and asked her if she was not well; she reply'd she was as well as ever, went out of doors, stay'd some short time, and return'd back again. As she was standing by the fire, she turn'd back her apron, and I saw the bottom of it was very bloody. Mrs. Johnson stood by and said to her, what ails your apron? she answer'd, her nose had been bleeding. I think she went out of doors again (but I am not quite sure of that) came in, and made a dispute about the form of prayer with one Walker; they had been at the printing office to buy them together, and one said that the one had five more than the other; then they called Mary Mitchel aside, what was said to her I don't know, but Mary Mitchel immediately called to me, and I went to her. Q. Cannot you recollect some words that she said? M. Lawson. No, she whisper'd; Mary Mitchel said to me, that Betty was very bad, that she had been to the necessary, where something had come from her, and that as I was a mother of children, I might be able to know whether it was a labour or not. I said, that though I was a mother of children, I was not capable of knowing that, for a certainty. Then Mary Mitchel asked me whether I would go and fetch a midwife, and I said that I would. Q. Did you go? M. Lawson. No, she would not give me time to go; and the prisoner said I had no need to go, for the child was down the necessary, and that she either heard it squeak, or cry (I don't know which of the words she made use of.) I told the prisoner she was mistaken, but she said she was not, and that if I would take a candle I might see the child. Then I and another woman went immediately from her. Q. What is that other woman's name? M. Lawson. Her name is Elizabeth Johnson ; I look'd down, and saw the child half in and half out of the soil; then I had a pair of tongs brought me, with which I caught hold of the child, but being in a flurry it fell out of the tongs; I laid hold of it again, and got it a great heighth, but it slip'd out of the tongs again. fell through the soil, and I could see no more of it; after that I went to Betty (meaning the prisoner) who was in the house, and said, Betty, Lord! what have you done, did you feel no pain when your child came into the world? she reply'd no, and added that she had come at seven months. Richard Burril . I am a constable. On the 28th of November I was called into Plough street, to take a woman into custody (which was the prisoner at the bar) for the murder of her bastard child, by throwing it into a vault. Q. At whose house? Burril. At Mr. Welch's, I went, and was given charge of the prisoner. I asked her how she could be so great a brute as to murder her child. She told me she had occasion to go to the vault, and the child drop'd from her, and that she had very little pain. Mary Mitchel . I used to go partners with the prisoner at the bar in fish. I have often taxed her, and said, Betty, you are very big, how long have you got to go? She always said to me, and a great many more, till the latter end of January, or the beginning of February. She went to the printing-office for some thanksgiving prayers on the 28th of November, to sell on the next day, being the thanksgiving day, and did not return again till about half an hour after eight at night, and then she came to the Man in the Moon alehouse, in Plough Street. When she came in I said, Betty, you have staid a great while. The woman that went with her said, if Betty had not been so big with child (by which means she had got her name set down) we must have come away without any papers. The prisoner went out some little time, and came in again. Then there was a dispute about some paper. I stood a little distance from her, and she beckoned me with her finger. I went to her, and understood her that she had been at the necessary house, and talk'd of something coming from her. I did not then understand that any thing had come from her. I went to a neighbour, and said, Betty has been to the necessary, and she is coming before her time; I understood something was coming, not come. I step'd to Mrs. Lawson, and said, I wish you will be so good as to step into our Nanny's house, and see how it is with Betty, for she had a very bad fall the day before. Q. Did you see her have that fall? M. Mitchel. No, I did not see it, but I heard it by a great many people; they all went out of the house with her except me, so I did not hear any thing of it till half an hour afterwards. Q. Was you at the necessary at the taking up of the child? M. Mitchel. I did go at the latter end, to hold the candle for Mrs. Lawson, who said she had hold of it, and I heard something fall. The girl always behaved well; I never heard otherwise by her in my life. Margaret Watson . A little better than half an hour after eight o'clock I went in at the Man in the Moon alehouse, in Plough Street. Q. What day of the month? M. Watson. On the 28th of November. There Betty (the prisoner) sat by the fire-side on the floor. I came out again with a pint of beer for my supper, and I believe I had been at home till very near nine, when Betty came to me. Q. Where is your house? M. Watson. I have a room in Mr. Welch's rents. Q. How long was it after you went home? M. Watson. I believe it was better than a quarter of an hour after I went to my room; I was eating my supper with my husband and two children. She pushed my door a-jar and had it in her hand, and spoke sharper than ordinary as I thought, and said, Peggy. I want to speak with you. I thought by her speaking something ail'd her more than common. She perceived my countenance change, being daunted at her speech. I said, Betty, what is the matter now? She said, nothing ails me Peggy, but I want to speak to you. When I came out I pull'd the door after me, and stood in the passage. She said, Lord, Peggy, what shall I do, I had occasion to go to the necessary house, and in straining my child came from me. I reply'd, Lord, Betty, what will you do for the child, for you will be hanged? She said, hanged for what, she was come before her time. She beg'd of me to give her something of a rag directly or cloth, so I gave her a piece of a rag that hung behind my door, and a skirt of an old gown. She bid me not to be frighted, for she should go about her business on the morrow. She made use of them in my room, and went away from me; I believe she might be gone from me ten minutes, when I went out and turn'd into the passage, to go to the necessary house where the thing was done; there I met Mrs. Lawson and my sister coming out of the necessary house, with a candle. I clap'd my hands together, and said, O wicked wretch, what had she done! Mrs. Lawson said to me, pray Peggy go and see, for you may see the child upon the soil. I went, but could not look down, I was so daunted. Mrs. Lawson said, we will see if we can get it up with a pair of tongs, so I went and borrowed a pair, and brought them to her. She had the child two or three times up, but could not hold it. After we had lost the child in the soil, and could see no more of it, I went up stairs to the prisoner, who was sitting upon a kind of a basket. I looked her in the face and began to talk to her, and said, how could you go to do such a thing? She beg'd I would not reflect, and said she could not help it, she felt no pain. Q. to the Midwife. Does not the after-birth usually come away with the child? Midwife. Sometimes there is a pretty while distance, an hour or two, and sometimes less; it is not always alike. Prisoner's Defence. I did not come to my reckoning, which was the latter end of January, or begining of February; I had every thing provided for the child, I did not want to make away with it; my things were seen by the neighbours, Margaret Watson and her mother know that I had things provided. For the Prisoner. Margaret Watson (again.) I saw the prison1er have two child's shirts, a cap, and three forehead cloths. Q. How long before this happened? M. Watson. I believe she might cut them out about two or three days before; I really saw her cut them out. She had asked a young body, an acquaintance of her's, to give her a blanket. Q. Was you present at the time? M. Watson. I was, the young body said she would give her one Q. What time was this? M. Watson. This was about a week before the thing happened. Mary Mitchel (again.) I know of her preparing som e linen, and I carried them to the workhouse to her; and I know the young woman that promised her a blanket, who asking her how long she had to go, she said, to the latter end of January, or beginning of February; then the other said, it is time enough to give it you. Acquitted, as delivered by surprise ."
1727-07-05,,1.0,,"459. (L.) Maria Jenkins was indicted for the wilful murder of her male bastard-child . She stood charged on the coroner's inquest for the said murder, August 25 . + Mary Clark . The prisoner at the bar lived servant with Mr. Fisher, an attorney at law in the Minories, about four months: I went to Mr. Fisher's on the 25th of August; I was told the servant was taken very ill; I am a relation of Mr. Fisher's; they sent for me; the prisoner's sister was there shutting up the windows; she seemed to be in a great confusion; I ask'd her what was the matter with her sister; she said she had been very bad, but was then better; then one of the women came that was to wash the next morning, had the maid been well; but as she was ill, they could not wash: the woman said there was a child, she was certain; I did not know what they meant; I had no suspicion; Mrs. Davis took a stick, and went to the necessary, and put it down, and said, there it was; I said, For God's sake send for a midwife; they sent for Mr. Complin, who came immediately; he went up stairs to Maria: I had not seen the prisoner, but I saw the child taken out of the necessary by Mrs. Davis's husband: Mr. Complin came down; this was before the child was found; and after it was found, he was sent for a second time; he ordered it to be wash'd; I saw it afterwards; it was a male child; there appeared no marks of violence upon it; it was a fine baby. Q. Have you had children? M. Clark. I have. Q. Did it appear to have come to its full birth? M. Clark. It did; the prisoner appeared always to me to be a very clever, decent person; I never suspected her. Elizabeth Davis . I have known the prisoner about five months; she lived all that time at Mr. Fisher's. Miss Shoreditch, Mr. Fisher's niece, sent for me about nine o'clock on Sunday night, the 25th of August; I went; she told me the prisoner was taken very bad, and I must sit up with her all night; I went up immediately to her bedside, and said, Maria, how do you do? she said she was much better, and much easier: I ask'd her if I should get her any thing; her sister made answer, she was going to get her something; I told her I was sent for to sit up with her all night; she told me I had no occasion for that, for she should; I came down stairs, and her sister with me; her sister carried her something up; after that the sister came down, and said she would go home and ask her master to let her sit up all night, and desired nobody to go up stairs, for Maria was much easier, and believed she would go to sleep. While her sister was gone, Mr. Complin was sent for by Mr. Fisher's niece; he went up to her, came down again, and said he saw nothing at all; that if she had had any thing, she denied it; then there was orders given to search the house. I, Martha Sharpham , and Mrs. Clark's maid, who is not here, went up stairs, and first went into Mrs. Fisher's room; we saw the floor sadly daubed over with blood at the foot of the bed. Q. Have you ever had a child? E. Davis. I am a married woman, but never had a child, nor was ever with any at a labour. We came down stairs, and told them what we saw, but could find nothing at all; then they desired us to look out backwards; we opened the back-door; there was the track of blood from the back-door to the necessary; I had a long stick; I put it down the necessary, and drew the child up; I fetch'd my husband, and he took it out; Mr. Complin was sent for again, and he went up to her. Cross Examination. Q. Can you tell which way the track went, whether from the back-door to the necessary, or from the necessary to the back-door? E. Davis. I cannot. Martha Sharpham . I knew the prisoner four months at Mr. Fisher's; the maid was so very bad, she could not wash; I wash'd for Mr. Fisher every month; I went that night a little before dark, time enough to have filled my tubs and copper; I saw Maria walking about in the kitchen, and her sister with her; she had her hands by her sides; she was not very well; her sister said she had got the piles; I saw some stuff in a pot on the dresser; then I went away for an hour. When I returned, the house was all in a confusion; she was gone to bed; Mrs. Clark was there; I went down into the kitchen, and they up stairs; I staid till Mrs. Davis and the sister came down; I said, What is the matter? I found they had seen some marks upon the stones in the yard. (I had had a mistrust she was with child two months before). Q. Did you ever tell her of it? M. Sharpham. No, I never did, nor any body else, as I know of. Her bigness appeared most on her sides: they search'd, and found the child in the necessary; I held the candle while it was taken up. Q. Have you had children? M. Sharpham. I have. Q. Did it appear to have come to its full birth? M. Sharpham. It did. Q. Did you see any marks of violence upon it? M. Sharpham. No, I did not. Q. Did you examine it? Mr. Sharpham. I did. Q. Have you ever seen any still-born children? M. Sharpham. I have. Q. Can you say it was a still-born child? Mr. Sharpham. I cannot; it was not quite cold; from thence is all my suspicion; it was the proper warmth of flesh and blood, I think. Towards the morning. I said to the prisoner, there was a fine baby below; she said nothing to it. Q. Did you examine her linen and sheets? M. Sharpham. I did; they appeared like that of a woman brought to bed, stained in that manner. Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing after this? M. Sharpham. She said it was too late to repent, she could not call it back: she was sorry for it. Q. Where do you imagine she was delivered? Mr. Sharpham. We imagined she was delivered in her mistress's room. Cross Examination. Q. Don't sometimes pains of a woman in labour come upon them when they can't help themselves? M. Sharpham. Yes, sometimes. Q. Suppose a pain should take them when on the necessary, can they help themselves? M. Sharpham. I don't suppose they could. Q. Was the woman perfectly delivered at the time you saw her? M. Sharpham. She was not; there was something came from her a great while after. Q. Might not the violence of her pains discharge the child while she was sitting on the vault? M. Sharpham. It might. Q. When you say she said she was sorry for what she had done, might not that be applied to letting a man get her with child? M. Sharpham. That might be the case. William Complin . I am a surgeon and man-midwife. I was sent for to Mr. Fisher's on the 25th of August, a little after nine o'clock; Mrs. Clark told me she believed there had been an unlucky accident; the maid had miscarried; that her sister had emptied something down the necessary; I said, I would go up and speak to her: I went up, and said, Maria, what is the matter with you? she said, I am better than I was: I said, I heard that you had something came from you; that you had miscarried: No, said she, I have not: I have been out of order two months, and now there has been rather too great a quantity than what naturally is: I asked her if I could do any thing for her; she said, No. I had another patient waiting for me; I went down, and said they must search the necessary house, and if they found any thing, they must send for me again: I went away, and about eleven o'clock they came and told me the child was found, and desired I would come directly. When I came, the child was lying on the ground, taken out of the necessary: I desired them to wash it, and bring it into the parlour; then I sent for Maria's sister down stairs, who was up with Maria: I asked what that was that she heaved down the necessary; she said it was water; I went up again to Maria, and asked her if she had not been brought to bed; she denied it; I said, You have no occasion to deny it now, for there was a child found that had not long been born; she still said it was not her's; I said, Considering the condition you are in, every body is convinced it is your's; then the lay still, and made no answer at all: I went down, and looked at the child, and found no marks of violence upon it: I told them they must let somebody take care of her that night, and I would come again in the morning: and I dar'd say every thing would come out: when I went in the morning. they shewed me what had come from her since I went away; then, upon my charging her with having had a child, she owned it; then I went away. I was ordered by the coroner the next evening, to open the body in the presence of another surgeon. We tried the usual experiment to know whether the child was born alive, that is, upon the lungs; if the lungs have imbibed the air. if the child has breathed, they will swim upon the surface of the water; if not, they will sink: we gave it as our opinion, that the child had breathed. N. B. The LAST PART of these PROCEEDINGS will be published in a few days.

PART II, for the YEAR 1765. LONDON: Sold by W. NICOLL, in St. Paul's Church-yard. [Price SIX-PENCE.] THE PROCEEDINGS ON THE King's Commission of the Peace, Oyer and Terminer, and Gaol-Delivery, held for the City of LONDON, & c. [Continuation of the Trial of Maria Jenkins .] Q. IF the child was born alive, and thrown into the little house, and drowned there, will the lungs always swim? Complin. Yes; if it was killed any way they would swim; besides, the soil was thick and stiff, and none of the water or nastiness was in its stomach; some might get up its nose. Q. How do you apprehend it was killed? Complin. It appeared to me it was stifled in the necessary. Q. Do not you think such a child as that might make a great noise, in being brought down stairs, if it was born alive? Complin. I think it might. Cross Examination. Counsel. Then this experiment is entirely from the inflation of the lungs? Complin. It is. Q. Suppose the child's head was to come into the open air, don't you think the child's lungs would be instantly inflated? Complin. Yes, if it gives but two gasps; if it cries, the child was born alive. Q. If a woman be upon the necessary, and was delivered there, in the agonies that come near the critical time, can she help herself? Complin. No, she cannot; she then requires all the help they can. Sometimes twenty minutes is taken up in the delivery of a woman. In the course of that time, the head of the child being discharged from the mother, when the mouth is in the open air, then the inflation commences: when the child opens its mouth, and the lungs are once inflated, they never afterwards become dense, till some time after death. Q. Might not that accident happen to a woman that finds pains upon her different from what she may think the pains of labour, and be taken in labour on the necessary, and be delivered of a child? Complin. Yes, that may be the case. Q. May not a child falling in the soil have the same appearance as this child? Complin. Yes. Q. to Sharpham. Did you see the after-burden? Sharpham. That was put upon a street, and I put it in the pot; then the prisoner was in bed; this was some hours after the child was found. Prisoner's Defence. I was taken very ill, I went out into the yard; Mrs. Davis promised to come to me, and never came nigh me; I had occasion to go to the necessary, and the child dropped from me there. For the prisoner. Mary Donnival . I have known the prisoner three years. I had some child bed linen that was my mother's; and I live with Mrs. Hucherson. I had lent them to her, and she said I might have them when I pleased to come for them. The prisoner came one time to see me; I thought she was with child; I said, I fancy you have stole a wedding; she said, When you see Mrs. Hucherson, I should be obliged to you, if you will get your child-bed linen. The last time she asked about it was the Sunday fortnight before she was delivered: the first time was three months before she was delivered. Q. Did she tell you she was with child? M. Donnival. No, she did not. Mary Hucherson . I live in Lemon-street. The last witness was my servant, in August; ( Maria Jenkins had lived with me). Donnival made application to me about some child-bed linen belonging to her, that was her mother's. I don't know who she wanted it for. Maria was very fond of my child, when she lived with me. Elizabeth Jasper , Catherine Hagers , Mary Hess , Ruth Beck , Elizabeth Walker , Frances Egars , John Garth , Joseph Hess , Andrew Neese , John Arney , and Kesia Allen , all gave her a good character, and one that was very fond of young children.

1727-12-06,,1.0,,"23. Mary Shrewsbury otherwise Threwsbury , was indicted for the Murder of her Male Bastard Child, by giving it a mortal Wound with a Knife in the Throat, of the Length of four Inches and the Depth of two Inches, of which it instantly died , Feb. 4 . She was a second Time indicted by Vertue of the Coroner's Inquest for the said Murder. Mr. Bay. This Accident happened in Moorfields on Friday 7-night last, Application was made to me on Suspicion of a Murder. I being Overseer of the Poor, went to the House, and the People told me the Child was put down the Vault. I put a Guard in the House that Night, and the next Morning I brought a skillful Mid-wife; we went up Stairs, and the poor Creature the Prisoner, was sitting upright in her Bed, with a Book in her Hand, and the Tears ran plentifully down her Face. There were five or six People in the Room, I asked them if they had searched the Room, they said they had; then I went down and searched the Vault, but I found no more than what is common in such Cases. Then I ordered the Vault to be emptied, and there was nothing found, though the Contents were well examined. I desired the Midwife to go up and examine the Woman again, she did not care to go without the Beadle, so he went with her, and they searched the Room again, and found the Child in a Hole in the Closet. She owned what was done she did herself, and that this other Woman here only emptied the Pot, so the Justice discharged her because the Prisoner took it all on herself. Q. Were there any Marks of Violence on the Child? Mr. Boy. Only the Head cut about half off. Ann Palmer , Midwife. The Parish Officer sent for me to examine the Prisoner; I found she had been delivered of a Child; when I enquired what she had done with it, she would make no direct Answer, but sat up in her Bed crying, with a Book in her Hand. I could get nothing out of her, but only, that what this Eliz. Bell had done, was by her Orders. I ask'd her what Bell had done; She would not tell me, but only desired I would be favourable, and Bell being gone away, I could not perswade her to tell me where she might be found. At last we found this Bell, and upon her Examination, she said she had put nothing down the Vault but the After-birth; for says she, the Child she threw down there herself. I went to the Prisoner again, and told her that Bell had inform'd us, that she (the Prisoner) had put the Child into the Vault: She own'd she did so, and beg'd I would be favourable in my Information, telling me, it was dead when she put it down. Well, says I, I hope you have not havock'd it; no, she said, she had not. Then the Vault was raked, and nothing found, but the After-burthen: Still she insisted upon it, that her Child was there; upon which it was quite empty'd, but no Child was found. I knew there must have been one born, so I search'd again, with the Beadle and other Women, and I took her out of Bed in a Blanket, and search'd the Bed, behind the Bed I found some Rags stain'd, &c. &c. - at the Feet of the Bed, I found a Box with more Rags in the same Condition: I shook them all out, but found no Child: In another Box I saw something that put me upon enquiring, what she had been doing in it: She told me, she had only put some Cloaths in it. At last we search'd the Closet, and in a Nook which ran into the Chimney, behind a small Trunk, we found it, sew'd up in a Cloth; when I pull'd it out of the Hole, the Prisoner swoon'd away. When she recover'd, I asked her several Questions, - how she could cut her Child's Throat so barbarously, and how she could in her present Condition have Strength to sew it up? She said the Devil had given her Strength, and not God. The Lord have Mercy upon you, says I, and so I left her. Q. Was the Child's Throat cut very much? Palmer It could not be cut worse, unless it's Head had been cut quite off. A Witness. This Bell was the Prisoner's Land- lady, and seeing her come down with a Mop and a Pail from the Prisoner's Room, I asked her what was the Matter; she told me that Mary, (the Prisoner) was not well. I went up, and knock'd at her Door, and she told me, the Key was under the Door; I open'd it and went in, and I ask'd her what she ail'd: I saw Spots of Blood upon the Floor, and I enquir'd how they came there; she said, she was as Women are, when they are disorder'd, but, says she, my Landlady Bell is coming to wipe them up In the Closet I saw a Pan full of Cloths, not very fit to be seen; - what's all this Mary, says I? God bless you, says she, don't say any Thing, I have miscarry'd and was three Months gone. I told her I was sorry for that, but however, I made her some hot Watergruel, and carry'd it to her in Bed, and left her to eat it. When I was got down Stairs, I endeavoured to settle my self to my Work, but I was very uneasy in my Mind, and (to make short of my Story) I could not rest 'till I had made some farther Enquiry. I ask'd her where she had put the Miscarriage, she told me that Bell had put it down the Vault. The Vault was search'd, but it was not there. It was found at last in a Nook, that went into the Chimney: I was present when 'twas pull'd out, and according to my Judgement 'twas at it's full Growth. Midwife. 'Twas at it's full Growth; it had Hair and Nails perfect, and was a larger Child than is common. Eliz Bell . I came home that Night about 10 o'Clock, and seeing a great deal of Blood upon the Floor, I asked the Prisoner how it came there; she said, don't be frighted, I have mis-carried, she desir'd me to tell no Body, and beg'd I would carry down the Pot. I got her some hot Ale, and then I went to Bed. C. You have behav'd very ill in this Affair, and you deserve to be severely reprimanded. You saw all the Symptoms of the Woman's being deliver'd, and instead of making a Discovery, you ran out of the Way. Your Proceeding was very shameful, and I am afraid you are as much concern'd in this Murder as the Prisoner her self, - Get you gone. Prisoner. It was dark when I was deliver'd, and the Child was dead. Guilty . Death ."
1728-01-17,,1.0,,"720. (M.) AMELIA POWELL was indicted for that she being delivered of a male bastard child alive, she did put both her hands about the neck of the said child, and of her malice aforethought did choak and strangle it, whereof the said child did instantly die . She also stood charged on the Coroner's Inquest with the said murder, Aug. 29 . * Thomas Bradford . I am beadle of the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. On the 29th of August last, which was a Sabbath-day, commonly called Sunday, Mr. Pleydell told me that his servant , the prisoner at the bar, that poor ignorant girl, had been delivered of a child, which he feared she had murdered, and desired me to go and inform the overseers of it, which I did. Mary Pleydell . The prisoner was my servant: I live at Lawrence-street, Chelsea . About twelve or one at noon, on Sunday the 29th of August, she was roasting a joint of meat; she went into the yard; my daughter called me, and told me there was something the matter with the prisoner; I went to her and accused her with having had a child; she said no she had not, nor knew nothing of one; I taxed her several times; I got her up into her own room; I sent for Mrs. Holmes, that recommended her to me; I went up stairs; I bid her confess what she had done with the child; she again declared she had had no child. Mrs. Holmes then went up stairs to her, but I did not go with her. Q. Do you know whether she had had a child or not? Pleydell. I saw some circumstances in the kitchen that convinced me she had had a child; after that the child was found. Mrs. Holmes staid up stairs with her very near half an hour. The overseers sent Elizabeth Bowman , and she went up to her. There were people sent to take up the necessary floor, and the child was found there; that was very near an hour after. I never saw the child. Q. Did you ever hear the prisoner say any thing more about it? Pleydell. No; I never spoke to her afterwards; she went away immediately to the workhouse. Cross Examination. Q. How old is the prisoner? Pleydell. I do not know certainly, about sixteen or seventeen; I believe I remember when she was in the charity school: she is a very ignorant girl. Q. She always bore a good character I believe? Pleydell. Yes, and was very diligent in her business, but very ignorant; I question whether she knows how long a woman should go with child. Mary Holmes . The prisoner had lived with Mrs. Pleydell near a month; Mrs. Pleydell sent for me, and desired me to go up stairs and tax her with it; I said Melia, Melia, what have you done? there is a child somewhere; she cried and trembled very much; she said she had occasion to go to the vault, and was delivered upon the vault. I saw the child about an hour after, when it was taken out of the vault; it was a male child. Q. Was it at its full time? Holmes. I did not observe any thing particular. Q. Did you see any marks of violence upon it? Holmes. I saw no marks of violence. Q. Did you observe its neck? Holmes. I looked at it and saw no marks of violence at all upon it. Elizabeth Bowman . I am a midwife: the beadle fetched me on the 29th of August to Mrs. Pleydell's; I went up stairs; I found the prisoner sitting up in a bed in the garret; I saw from circumstances something was the matter; I asked her what was the matter; she said nothing; I told her I suspected she had been delivered of a child; she said she had not had a child. Q. Was Mrs. Holmes there then? Bowman. I believe she was; directly upon that, the daughter of the woman of the house said, the prisoner had owned it was down the necessary; I told them the necessary must be opened; it was opened and the child was taken up; I saw it about a quarter of an hour after it was taken up; it was a fine child; there were no marks of violence upon it. Q. Did you search it narrowly? Bowman. Yes. Q. Did you observe it's neck? Bowman. I did observe every part of it. Q. I suppose it is a possible thing that a woman might be surprised and delivered at a necessary? Bowman. She said the child came from her at the necessary, and it was possible to be so; I knew an instance of a married lady, in great credit, very near like it; she desired to go to the necessary; I objected to it; she did not suppose herself so near delivery; she went there; she was taken very bad, and the child dropt before I got her to the bed. Acquitted ."
1728-08-28,,1.0,,"3. Sarah Allen , was indicted, for that she Oct. 6 . being big with a certain Male Child, in the Dwelling House of John Fryar , in the Parish of St. Gile's in the Fields, the said Child she did bring forth alive, which Child so born, was a Bastard by the Laws of this Realm; and she not having God before her Eyes, &c. - on the said Bastard Child as soon as it was born, did make an Assault, and being in a certain Garret three Stories high, with both her Hands, she the aforesaid Bastard Child did cast and throw down from the Window, to and against a certain Stone Pavement in the Street, giving it, by such casting and throwing down, a mortal Bruise on the back part of the Head, of which it instantly died . She was a 2d Time indicted by Vertue of the Coroner's Inquisition for the said Murder. Eliz Scott . Last Thursday Morning I was coming down Holborn about 6 o'Clock, and between the Bull and Gate and Great Turnstile, I saw something lie in the Kennel, which surprized me. I call'd to my Partner, - Lord, Betty (says I) come hither! when we came to look at it, we found it was a new born Child; - it lay in the Kennel, just against Mr. Fryar the Baker's Door. We took it up, and found it was dead, so we laid it on a Bulk two Doors from Mr. Fryar's, and being very much 'frighted, I went to Mr. Birkhead's over the Way for a pint of Purl, while I was drinking the Purl, News came that the Mother of the Child was found. I ran out, and found the Child had been brought into Mr. Fryar's House, he bid me be easy, but I said, I would not stir from the Door till the Constable was fetch'd; then I went up to see the Child again, and I found the Prisoner in Bed, and the Child in the Room with her, - in a Garret up 3 pair of Stairs. I asked the Prisoner, how she could be so barbarous to throw her Child out of the Window? All I could get from her was, - the Lord knows. Why, says I, it will certainly cry in your Face, she said nothing, but the Lord knows. Q. Did she own it to be her Child? Scott. I can't say whether I asked her if it was her Child or no; she only said, - the Lord knows. Eliz White . I was going to the New Market with my Partner, and she call'd me to look at something that lay in the Kennel. We soon saw 'twas a Child; so I took hold of the Head, and she - of the Heels, and we laid it upon a Cork-cutters Bulk, 2 Doors below Mr. Fryar's. A Woman that was by, gave us a Piece of Sacking, and we cover'd 'it with that, - for it was stark naked. Then we went to Mr. Birkhead's for a Pint of Purl, and while we were there, we heard that the Mother was found, and that the Child was carried away. Sarah Lack . I lodge in Mr. Fryar's House, but I never saw the Prisoner from the Time she came to our House, 'till the Morning the Accident happen'd. My Husband hearing a Noise, look'd out of the Window, and seeing something in the Kennel, he told me, he feared something was amiss, and desired me to go up Stairs. I went' up, and rapp'd at the Door, it was lock'd, and no Body answer'd: Upon this, I went to her Aunts Room, (one Mrs. Woolham) and told her she must get up, for I feared something was amiss with her Kinswoman. I told her, I was frighted out of my Wits, for there was a Child found in the Street, and I was afraid it was her Kinswoman Sarah's. We went up together to the Prisoner's Garret, and knock'd at the Door, the Aunt call'd to her, and bid her open the Door; and as she stood at the outside of the Door, she asked her, - how it was with her now? The Prisoner said, she was pure, to what she had been, and then she opened it. As soon as I came in, I saw something unusual on the Floor, upon which I ran to her, - with my Hands so, - and cry'd, O Lord, Sarah, - what have you done! This must be your Child, and you have thrown it out of the Window She made a very silly Answer, - it is so, or it must be so, or something to that Effect; but I was so frighted, that I can't remember the particular Words, and the People flock'd up Stairs so fast, that I could hear no more. There was a Bed in the Room, but I did not examine it. I remember I asked her who got the Child? And she told me 'twas Horatio Walpole's under Coachman's, who goes by the Name of Black Will . Mary Giles , Midwife. I live next Door to Mr. Fryar's, about 6 o'Clock the Morning the Accident happened, I heard a Noise in the Street, so I got out of Bed and look'd out of the Window, I saw a couple of Women in the Street, in a great Flurry of Spirits about a Child. I thought it was only a Child that had been dropp'd, so I went to Bed again, and slept 'till about 8 o'Clock; then I was called up by the Mob, and I went (without my Stockings) to the Prisoner's Garret, there I beheld a Male Child, lying upon the Table; and I imagine it wanted about a Fortnight or 3 Weeks of its Time. There was a small Bruise on the left Side of the Head. When I had view'd the Child, I went to the Prisoner, - and oh you wicked Creature, says I, how could you do this wicked Deed to the Body of your Body, and Flesh of your Flesh? She said, she did not know what she did, or something to that Purpose. I laid her in Order, &c. - and said, - come, if she has been wicked don't let us be so too, let her have something warm; but Hussy, says I to her, how could you do this? this Child I am sure was born alive; she said, yes it was I asked her if it cryed? she said yes Then I went away, because the People said, I must not touch her 'till the Coroner came. William Brumfield , Surgeon. I was sent for to examine the Child, I found a large Bruise on the back Part of the Head, which we call the Os Occipitis. The Scull was not fractured, and the Reason it was not I think is this; that in a Subject to young, the Bones are of too fine a Texture to break. I took off the Cranium, and found a large quantity of Blood upon the Brain, which I suppose was occasioned by the Fall. There was likewise a great deal of Blood in the Belly and Breast, which proceeded from the Rupture of some Blood Vessel, and these Things were the Occasion of its Death. I try'd the Experiment of the Lungs in Water, (which I take to be very certain) and they floated; this in my Opinion, was a sure Sign that the Child had breath'd; for if it had not, they would have subsided in the Water. Jane Raikes . The Prisoner complain'd of the Cholic the Tuesday Night before this happen'd, and I carried her up some burnt Gin. On Wednesday Morning I went up to her again, and found her Aunt with her, she said she was still very ill of the Cholic, and the next Morning the Child was found in the Street. Upon this I went up to her Garret, and found it in great Disorder, there were Signs of a Womans having been deliver'd, and the People told her, that it was her Child; She did not deny it, but told us, that Horatio Walpole 's under Coachman was the Father; and that was all I heard. A Witness. The Prisoner always was a silly, giggling Creature - C. You must be sworn, if you have any Thing to say. Witness. As to swearing - I will swear any thing - of that Matter - but my Lord, I have known her ten or a dozen Years; she was not so silly neither, but she was capable of Business. I know she liv'd two Years, or two Years and a half, with Mr. Howard, that belongs to the Crown- Office, and always was a giggling, silly, empty Creature. The Prisoner in her Defence had nothing material to offer, only that she was out of her Senses when she committed this Fact. The Jury found her Guilty . Death ."
1729-02-26,,1.0,,"275. (M.) Frances Palser , spinster , was indicted for the murder of her female bastard child . She stood likewise charged on the coroner's inquest for the said murder, June 6 .* Anne Dickerson. I am servant to Mr. Hopsore at Highgate, and have been two months this day. The prisoner was my fellow-servant ; she had lived there about 12 months before me; I took her to be dropsical the first day I saw her; she and I used to lie together. I went to bed on the Thursday-night yesterday was month, and whether she came to bed to me or not I can't tell. I awoke at 5 in the morning, and went down without dressing myself to the clock in the hall, to see what o'clock it was. There I saw her. I ask'd her how she came to be up so soon? She said she was not very well, and was coming up to lie down again. I went into bed, and presently after she came up, and lay down by me with her cloaths on. She desired me several times to get up, between 5 and 6, and said she was not very well. I got up about six. She asked me to get her something to drink; and said she was very ill. I said I wou'd make her some mint and balm tea, She said she could not drink it. I said I would get her any thing else. She said she had made herself some caudle, but it was too thick. I ask'd if I should make her any better? She said she did not care if I did. I made her some, and carried it to her. When I went down I was surprised to find the doors open. Q. What doors? Dickerson. The kitchen door, the necessary-house door, and a door behind it. I went into that place behind the necessary, and look'd about, and miss'd some brickbats out of it. This gave me a suspicion that her distemper was not dropsical, but otherwise; for I saw something about the kitchen that was not there before. Q. What was that? Dickerson. I saw some blood about. She drank the caudle, and lay there after my mistress was got up. Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner of your suspicion when you carried her up the caudle ? Dickerson. No; I did not. After she had drank it, I went down into the kitchen again; then I went up to her again, and ask'd her how she did? She said she was no better. Then my mistress rang the bell. This was about 7 o'clock. She ask'd me what o'clock it was: I went and told her. She rang the bell again about 8, and ask'd for the prisoner, who was her own maid. I told her she was very ill, and could not come down. My mistress got up, and went up to see her, and I with her. She told us she was very ill. My mistress came down stairs, and mull'd her some wine, and sent it up to her. I shew'd my mistress what I had observ'd in the kitchen as soon as she went there. After that my mistress sent to Mrs. Haines, a neighbour, to know what was good for her. Mrs. Haines came, and went up to her. When she came down, I told her what I had seen in the kitchen; then she said she thought there was something more than what she had told her was the matter with her; and ask'd me if I had look'd in the necessary? I said no. Sometime after that I look'd down there, and saw some brickbats down in it, and told my mistress of it; and in the afternoon the child was found there; but I was above-stairs when it was found. Cross examination. Q. Where did you see this blood? Dickerson. Some on the hand-towel, some on the ground, and some on a piece of flanel. Q. Did you hear her call in the necessary-house? Dickerson. No; I did not. I slept very sound. Q. Was there any impression in the bed where she lay? Dickerson. I could not tell; for I got up in a flurry upon missing her. Q. Do you know of any preparation she had made of child-bed linnen? Dickerson. No; I never saw any. Barbara Walton . I was sent for to Mr. Hopsore's on the 6th of June, about 8 at night, as near as I can guess. I went up to the prisoner, and found her upo n the bed, and asked her how she did ? She made me no answer. Q. Did she know you before? Walton. No; I never saw her before. I examined what was the matter with her, and told her she'd had a child. Q. Had you been shew'd any thing in the kitchen? Walton. No; I had not then. Q. Are you a married woman? Walton. I am a widow, and a midwife. I asked her where the child was? She said I sentenced her very hard. I said she'd had a child; and bid her tell where it was. She said she'd had none. I told her I was sure of it; and if she had not, there was all that belong to a child with her. Then I went down, and told her mistress there was a child somewhere; and we imagined it to be in the necessary-house. Her mistress took a candle, and went along with me there, and look'd down, and saw a parcel of brickbats there. We called the next door neighbour. He and his man came to search it. I went up to the prisoner, and had finished all there. When I came down, there lay the child by the hall door. I wrap'd it up, and carried it to the prisoner, and bid her look at it, and see what a fine child there was. She looked at it, but said nothing. Q. Was this child at full growth? Walton. There is no certainty as to that; it had nails on its fingers, and hair on its head. I thought it was at full growth. Q. Was it male or female? Walton. It was a female child. Q. Was there any experiment made in your presence, to know whether it was born alive? Walton. No; there was not. Q. Were there any wounds on it? Walton. No; no more than what the brickbats had made. There was a little wound on the arm, another on the thigh, and the head pretty much bruised. Q. Do you think it was born alive? Walton. There is no certainty as to that. Cross examination. Q. Is it not common, when child-bed pains are coming upon a woman, to have a tendency of going to the necessary-house ? Walton. Yes; very often. Q. If she had been drawn to the necessary-house by these pains, might not this child suddenly slip from her? Walton. It is very possible. Q. From the appearance of the child, how long might it have been born, do you think? Walton. About 14 hours. William Walden . I was sent for to search the necessary-house. I went with my servant, and was present after we had taken up the floor. When he took the child out of the necessary-house, we laid it upon the steps going into the hall door. Mrs. Walton had a pail of water fetched, with which the child was washed; then she took it up stairs. Benjamin Colebourn . I am a surgeon. The prisoner being ill, I was sent for. I inquired of the mistress, and the first evidence; and suspected there either had or would be a labour. I ask'd the prisoner a few questions; and told her she should send for a midwife. She told me she had no business with a midwife. I told her there was something in her body that wanted to be fetched away, or she would die before morning. Then she consented. I told her, after the midwife had been with her, I would order her what was proper; but before she had been with her, I could not order her any thing. After the midwife had been with her, she came and told me she'd had a child. Then I ordered her something; and the next day I saw the child in the prisoner's room. Q. Was the child at full growth? Colebourn. It was as much as I can judge of a child. Q. Why was not the experiment made on the child's lungs? Colebourn. The coroner asked me whether I thought the child was born alive? I said it was very difficult to distinguish that. After that he said, will you try the experiment upon the lungs ? And there was water brought up. I asked him what he did expect upon that? He said, for me to give a final answer, whether it was born alive or not. Then I declined it, as looking upon it not conclusive. Cross examination. Q. Have you ever known a case where the child has been at full growth, and has been stillborn ? Colebourn. I have, many. Q. Have not women always a tendency to go to stool when in strong labour pains? Colebourn. The major part have: I believe 18 in 20. Q. Might not that be a reason of her going there? Colebourn. I can't say what were her reasons. Prisoner's defence. I had occasion to go to the necessary-house, between 4 and 5 o'clock; the clock struck five while I was sitting there. There I had an uncommon pain took me, and the child dropt from me; and I sat there some time before I could stir. I had some child-bed linen, which I made in my spare time; and I had sow'd it into my quilted petticoat by my side. I called when my pains came upon me, but could not make any body hear me. The reason I did not let my child-bed linen be seen, was this; I had lived with my mistress a year and a quarter, if I had staid till the 13th of the last month; and I had no money to support me in my illness, without I had staid my quarter up; and if I had let my case be known before, I should be turn'd away, and not have that quarter's wages. To her character. Fra. Hathey. I have known the prisoner from a little child. We were both born at Wooten-underhedge in Gloucestershire, from whence she came about a year and an half ago. I lived over-right against her. The children there were as fond of her as possible, and she seemed to take as much delight in pleasing children. Of all that ever I saw of her I should be far from thinking her guilty of doing a murder. Mary Hathey . I have known her 20 years in Gloucestershire. She always had the best of characters. I really think she would not be guilty of killing a child. David Rice. She lived at my house, when she was in Mr. Hopsore's service, fourteen months. She behaved very well during that time. James Rice . I have known the prisoner sixteen years. I came from Gloucestershire. She bears a general good character there. I never heard she was suspected of any ill thing. She is of a very good disposition toward children. I have reason to believe she would not be guilty of such an action as she is charged with. Mary Whithouse . I have known her thirteen months. I live an opposite neighbour to Mr. Rice, where she lived. I always took her to be a very sober girl. Richard Mason . I have known her about two years. She had a universal good character by all that knew her. Elisabeth Pember . I lived in the house with her at Mr. Rice's. We always thought her a very sober body; far from a cruel disposition. Anne Siden . I live next door to Mr. Rice. I have known the prisoner about fourteen months. She was always a pretty behaved body. She has taken my children out of my arms and play'd with them. She had a universal good character. David Rice again. I am an apothecary. I remember an instance of the like kind: The midwife was playing at cards, and the woman was suddenly taken, and dropt the child suddenly on the floor; that child had nails on its fingers, and hair on its head. Acquitted ."
1729-04-16,,1.0,,"67. (M.) James Field was indicted for the wilful murder of a new born child, by casting it into a tub of water , Nov. 13 . * Mary Duck . I live at Potter's Bar , in the parish of South Mims. The prisoner is a day labouring man , he lives just by me; I have known him from a child; he had been in that house but about five weeks: he lived with a woman, but I look upon it they were never married. He came to me in the dusk of the evening, on the 13th of November, and said, dame Duck, come and go to my wife, for I think she is fetching her last breath; I went with him; I asked him what she ailed; he said she had an ague and fever; after that I asked him again, and he said, indeed it is a miscarriage; I said, where have you been all day; he said, at home; I said, why did you not come to me sooner, and I would have fetched three or four, or half a dozen women; he said, she would not let him come for any body; this was as we went along; he went in, and up stairs, and I followed him; he held his face cross his wife's face, and said, Lord have mercy on me, my wife is dead! Q. Was any body in the house beside you and he? M. Duck. There were only he and I, and his five children. I took hold of her hand, it was very cold. Q. How far distance between his house and your's? M. Duck. Not a quarter of a mile; his house is in Enfield parish . I said, give me a handkerchief and I'll tie up her jaw; I did: I turned myself round, and saw a half butter firkin set under the bed; I pulled it out; there I saw a child, which frighted me very much; I then went and fetched some other women, and four of us laid her out; after that I took the child out of the tub, and laid it on a blanket and cleaned it. Q. Where was the prisoner at that time? M. Duck. He was below stairs; I took a chamber-pot full of water out of the tub, and I believe there was about half another in it. Q. Where was he when you first took notice of the child? M. Duck. He was gone down stairs. Q. Did you say any thing to him when you went to fetch the other women? M. Duck. No, I did not say a word to him; we neither of us asked him any questions about it; we examined the child, it was a girl. Q. Was it full grown? M. Duck. I think it was, it had nails and hair; there were no marks of violence upon it; the child was parted the same as if a midwife had parted it, and all were in the tub together; then we went down stairs and left the man below, and said nothing to him; after we were out at the door he desired me to go and send one George, a cobler; I went, he not being at home, I went and got a woman to be with him; I went with the woman; he said, that will be of no service at all to be here to night; then we went away, and left him and the five children in the house; he came and fetched the woman in the morning: I went there about ten or eleven in the morning, to help the woman to wash the linen; I had laid the child by the woman, and there I found it; he was then gone to church to get leave of the parish to bury them. On the Saturday or Sunday, as he sat in my house, I asked him if the child was born alive; he said he did not know. Q. When were they buried? M. Duck. The child and woman were both buried on the Sunday; the woman was a stranger; I never saw her but once before, and never spoke to her in my life. Dorothy Ripard . I went at Mrs. Duck's desire to the prisoner's house; I took Mrs. Roberts and Mrs. Sams with me; Mrs. Duck met us there; the man met us at the gate; we said we were surprized he did not call some women to his wife's assistance; he said she would not let him; we went up stairs, and found the woman dead on the bed; Mrs. Duck, I, and Mrs. Sams, laid the woman out; then we took the child out of the water, and took a chamber-pot full of water out of the tub, and I believe there remained half a chamber-pot full more in the tub; Mrs. Duck laid the child on a blanket, and laid it by the side of the mother. There were no marks of violence about it; it was a female child; we called to the prisoner to know if he had ever a sheet to lay over his wife; he said he had never a one; I said, then lend us a table-cloth for decency; he said he had none; then we came down stairs, and I was the last woman that went out of the house; he said he had some gin in the house and asked if I chose to drink a glass of gin; I did not chuse it; then he desired I would tell Mrs. Duck to send George Howard to him at night; I went and sent Mrs. Duck back to take her message herself; I was over frighted, and did not go near him after that Q. Had Mrs. Duck told you before you went she had seen the child? D. Ripard. She told me she had found a child in a tub under the bed. Q. How near do you live to the prisoner? D. Ripard. I live about 20 poles from him; he came to our house on the Friday morning, to get a horse to go to church; then I asked him how the child came in the tub of water; whether he heard me I cannot say, he turned himself and gave me no answer; he came to our house also on the Sunday (we keep a public-house) for four gallons of beer; I knew nothing of him before he came to live there; he had been there about 5 or 6 weeks; he had five children in the house. Mary Sams . I was one of the women that helped to lay the woman out; I asked the prisoner at first going in, why he did not fetch some women to his wife; he said she would not let him: we laid the woman out, then took the child out of the tub and cleaned it, and laid it by her, and then came away and said nothing to him. Catharine Roberts . I have no more to say than what has been said; I never spoke to the prisoner, or was in the house afterwards. Mr. Roberts. I am a surgeon. On the 25th of November I was sent for by the officers of the parish, and the coroner, to meet him at Mims; there were various reports that the woman and child were murdered; I believe this was seven or eight days after the woman and child had been buried; they had taken the woman and child up; the child was laid under the bellfry, I believe the name of the place they call the bone-house: I examined it; all the jury were with me; I opened the chest, and separated the lungs from the other part, and suspended them in water; it is generally imagined, that in case they sink, they have been no ways inflated, or received the air; they swam upon the surface of the water, but I believe they barely had received air they were so triflingly inflated; I blowed into them afterwards, to convince the jury of what a deal of difference there was, when they had received a due portion, and when they had received little or none. Q. What is your opinion about this experiment? Roberts. I am not always quite satisfied as to that; from my own knowledge and experience I cannot positively declare, that the child was born alive; as Mrs. Duck mentioned at that time, that every thing was done as if by a midwife, I expected to see every thing was so done; but when I came to inspect that, there were four or five hand breadths of the navel-string left; an effusion of blood might happen from that, which might destroy the child; the end of it seemed to me to be rather torn than cut: that is a circumstance that should be paid due regard to, in every child that is born. Q. Were there any marks of violence upon it? Roberts. No, there were not. I was desired likewise to inspect the body of the woman; there were no marks of violence on the body, nor no bad appearance. Q. Was that a sufficient quantity of water as has been mentioned here to drown a child? Roberts. To be sure it was; there was a trifle of water in the child, but the coffin was full of water when they were taken up. Prisoner's defence. I was bad 3 weeks, and my wife was bad a fortnight, with the fever and ague; we nursed one another as well as we could; she was worse that day, being the Thursday, than any day; I had had a pair of shoes of a shoemaker, and a bottle of stuff, which he sells for a pain in the side; I took 30, 40, 45 drops at a time; he said it would do my wife good; it had done me good; I gave her a few drops of it in a little tea; she thought herself better, after that she thought herself worse; then she desired me to make her a little gin hot; I got some, and gave her a dram of cold gin; she was very bad; I said, shall I fetch any body; no, she said, she was a stranger in the place: I asked her again; she would not have any body sent for; she grew worse and worse. In about an hour after she drank the gin she miscarried; I said, dear heart, what is the reason you did not tell me of all this; why did you not tell me you was in labour; said she, I shall be very well, hold your tongue, I am as well as if I had 20 women here, I have done all the work myself; the chamber-pot was full by the bed-side; I was not in the room at the time of her labour; I was with the children below; she desired me to bring up something to empty the pot in, and I carried up a half butter firkin which she used to wash in; if there was any water in it, it was but a trifle: she grew so ill that I could not understand what she said; then I went for Mrs. Duck; I came from the same parish to that house, but I am quite a stranger there; that place is five miles distance from where I came from. Q. to Duck. How did the prisoner's children appear? Duck. They were very well, hearty and clean, for a poor man's children; they looked as if they had been taken care of; the prisoner behaved well when he was a boy; I knew him a child, but I had not seen him for 26 years, till he came to that place. Acquitted ."
1729-05-21,,1.0,,"Rebecca Prince , of the Parish of St. Brides , was indicted for the Murder of her Male Bastard Infant, by throwing it into a Vault , the 18th of January . Elizabeth Yates depos'd, That the Prisoner having given her her Linnen to wash, she perceiv'd some Tokens on them, that made her suspect the Prisoner had had a Child, whereupon she went and acquainted her Mistress. Elizabeth Domville depos'd, That she, upon the Information of the former Evidence, sent for a Midwife, that upon being examin'd, she confess'd she had had a Child, and had put it in the Vault. The Midwife depos'd, That she saw the Child after it was taken out of the Vault, but perceiv'd no Marks of Violence upon it, that she readily confest her having a Child, said that she was very ill in the Night, in a Fit, and the Child came from her the mean Time, and when she found it was dead, that she kept it three Days in the Bed, and design'd to have carried it and left it in some Church-Yard, and did bring it down on the Sunday, but the Family coming home, she was prevented, and then threw it down the Vault. The Midwife likewise depos'd, That she had spoke to her to lay her four Months before, and had spoken to her again, about two Months before, and also about ten Days before; and that she did believe the Child was still born, because what should have come away with it, came not away till the Night after. That she was a sickly, weakly Creature, and she had made some Provision for the Prisoner's Child, when born, by her Desire. The Prisoner, in her Defence, pleaded to the same Purpose, that the Midwife had depos'd, adding, That she had a Fall the Night before, which she thought occasion'd her hasty Delivery. The Jury, upon a full hearing of the Matter, acquitted her."
1730-08-28,,1.0,,"24. Mary Doe , was indicted for the Murder of her Male Bastard Infant, by strangling and choaking it with both her Hands , on the 29th of October last. Frances Crook , Midwife. On the 30th of October, I was sent for to the Prisoner, and found she had been delivered of a Child. She said, something (she knew not what) was come from her, but it was no Child. I ask'd her, what she did with that which came from her? She said she did not know where it was. I told her it signify'd nothing to deny it, for I was sure she had had a Child, and therefore a Child I would find. Then she confess'd that it was a Man Child; but said it was born dead, and that her Father took it from her, but she could not tell what he had done with it. Her Father coming in I told him his Daughter had been Deliver'd - Deliver'd ! says he, Ay, so she has - of a Sir-Reverence. Those were his Words, begging your Worship's Pardon. I saw so much by his Behaviour towards the Prisoner, and some other Passages, that in short, I told him, I believ'd he was Father to the Child, as well as Grandfather; and that he had done my Business, and deliver'd her himself before I was sent for. So he went out, and I examin'd the Prisoner, and she declar'd to me, that her Father had lain with her, and that she never had to do with any other Man but him. On the 2d of November following, the Prisoner's Mother gave me a Note, I suppose it was sent from her Husband, who was then run away, and in this Note, it was said, that the Child was wrapt up in an old Curtain, and laid in among some Horse-litter in Tom Turd's-Hole (a Place where the Nightmen lay their Soil) and there it was found. I saw no Marks of Violence upon it; but I believe it bled to death for want of proper Help. Joseph Sandford , Surgeon, in Goodman's-Fields. On the 2d of November last a Male Infant (suppos'd to be born of the Prisoner, Mary Doe ) was brought to me to have my Opinion, whether it had been Still-born, or not. I view'd the Body, and found no external Marks of Violence; upon which I proceeded to open the Cavities of the Thorax and Abdomen. The Lungs appear'd inflated ; I cut off one of the Lobes, and putting it into a Vessel of Water, it floated; I am therefore of Opinion that the Infant had breathed; I likewise found that the Blood-vessels in general were empty, and the Navel-string lacerated, and not ty'd; for which Reason, I believe, proper Help was wanting, and the Child might bleed to Death. Mary White . The Prisoner and her Father and Mother liv'd in a Room in my House for many Years; her Father is a Journeyman Carpenter, and her Mother went out a Washing. The Prisoner, as far as ever I saw, always behaved herself prettily and modestly, tho' at last, poor Creature, she happen'd to be with Child, and she was deliver'd in my House. Court. Did she call for Help ? M White. I cannot say that I heard her. Court. Do you think she was so weak that she could not, or that she was under any Surprize, and her Labour came so suddenly that she had not Time to call for Assistance? M. White. I know nothing as to those Things, but here is a Waistcoat proper for a young Child, which found in a Waistcot Box in her Room, and she said she had provided it for that Purpose; and she told me her Father took the Child from her - poor young Creature - she's hardly Sixteen - her wicked Father has ruin'd her. John Tindall , Constable. The Midwife brought me a Note with Directions to search for the Child among some Sraw, by the Hog-house in Tom T - d's-fields, and there we found it wrapp'd up in a Linsey-Woolsey Curtain - Her Father is in Reading Goal. Susan Glover . I have known the Prisoner two or three Years; I always took her for a good- natur'd, inoffensive, modest Girl, and I was extreamly startled at the News of her having had a Child; I talk'd with her about it - she complain'd of her Father for deluding her, and said she had indeed had a Child, but that her Father took it from her, and she did not see it more. There were no Marks of Violence on the Child, and I believe it might bleed to death thro' her Ignorance and want of proper Help. Eleanor Whitchurch . I always took her for an honest sober Girl before this Misfortune, and I believe the Child might die for want of Help. The Jury acquitted her."
1731-01-15,,1.0,,"22. Mercy Hornby , of Stoke-Newington , was indicted for the Murther of her Female bastard Infant, by casting it alive into a Privy, by which Casting it receiv'd one mortal Bruise on the left side of the Head, of which mortal Bruise it instantly dy'd , March 15 . She was a second Time indicted on the Coroner's Inquest for the said Murther. Elizabeth Husk . Friday Morning was 5 Weeks, about 9 o' Clock, I met Mrs Pain, who said she was going to see the Prisoner at Stoke-Newington. An Hour afterwards, I saw Mrs Pain again, and she said the Prisoner was very bad; so I went to see the Prisoner. She was sitting up in her Bed, and I asked her how she did? She said, very bad at her Head and Stomach. When I came down, I asked Mrs Pain if she had seen nothing? For the Kitchen was in Disorder, and had been wash'd and sanded, and there was a Bloody-apron. She said she had seen something, and that the Prisoner had thrown something down the Vault. I stept over the Way, (for I live opposite to where the Prisoner lives) and told my Mistress. She bid me light a Candle, and look in the Vault. I did, and saw a Child there; but I was so frighted, that I could not take much notice. I sent for help to take it out, and then I saw only a little Blood on the Head of it. It was a Female, and seem'd to be new born. Court. Did you observe the Navel, or any thing about it, belonging to a new born Child? E. H. No. It was filthy with the Soil of the Privy. Prisoner. Was it a Stone Kitchen? E. H. No. A boarded Floor? Prisoner. Was I alone, or was any of the Family in the House? E. H. I don't know - I saw none but you when I first came. Prisoner. Was the Child cover'd in the Vault? E. H. No. It lay clear. Prisoner. How deep was the Vault? E. H. I don't know. Prisoner. Was it a slight Bruise on the side of the Head, or a large one? E. H. I did not search - A Midwife was sent for after the Child was found; but she did not come till next Day. Margaret Pain . The Prisoner sent for me by a Neighbour's Girl between 9 and 10 in the Morning. She let me into the Kitchen her self. I ask'd what ail'd her? She said, she was not very well, nor had not been well since Whitsuntide : That she had been very bad that Morning, and had been at the Vault; but was now something better, and could eat a little Water gruel. I made her some, and then she went to Bed, and bid me lock the outer Door, and take the Key. There was Nobody else in the House - The Kitchen was a little out of Order; I saw it had been mopp'd up, but I saw no foul Clothes. We did not let her know that the Child was found, till her Master and Mistress came down, and that was between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon. And then I asked her how she came to do so? And she said, the Devil prompted her. Prisoner. What did you understand I meant by saying so? - That I carried it to the Place, or that I murder'd it? M. P. I don't know what you meant. Mary Fauks , Midwife. On Saturday the 16th of March, I was sent for by the Prisoner, to free her of the After-birth, and I made her a free Woman and left her safe. I was sent for on the Friday, but could not go, - I saw the Child, it was as fine a Female as ever I set my Eyes on, and I don't question but it was full grown; for I believe it was 3 quarters (of a Yard long) and I believe it was born alive, for I can't think so large a dead Child could make it's own way. There was a great Bruise on this side of the Head? Prisoner. Might not that come by a Fall at it's Birth? M. F. I can't say that. Prisoner. Did not you take some Child-Bed-Linnen out of my Trunk. M. F. Yes; a Shirt, a Blanket, and a Night-Cap, a Biggin, and a long Stay; but these I did not see till Monday, and it's much to be fear'd, that you did not put them there; for indeed I was inform'd they were borrow'd of a Neighbour. Court. That's no Evidence - You must not swear what you heard, but only what you know. Mr. Coulson, Surgeon. I found a large Contusion on the side of the Child's-head, which I believe was the Cause of it's Death. The Bruise might happen by the Child's falling from her, for a Child falls with a prodigious force. Thomas Pain . I built the Vault not long ago, and was sent for, to take the Child out; but it was taken out by Mr. Jordan. The Vault is but 6 Foot deep, and the Depth of the Soil was not above 3 Inches, or 3 and a half. The Breadth of the Seat is 22 Inches; there is no Cross-bars within. The Back of it lies open, and the Bottom is not paved, but is a soft Sand. Prisoner. Could the Child receive such a Bruise as to kill it, by falling down that way. Surgeon. - I think not. John Jourdan . The Child lay upon its back, and did not seem to be daub'd at all. I got a Ladder, and went down 4 or 5 Rounds, and try'd to take it with a Rake; but when I had raised it 2 or 3 foot, it fell down again, and that daub'd it pretty much. There was a Bruise and some Blood about it's Head, but the Skin was not broke. Prisoner. I was taken very bad in Bed, between 5 and 6 in the Morning. I came down Stairs, and call'd for help as well as I could, but there was Nobody else in the House. The next Door was an Ale-house, and a Noise being there, I believe they could not hear me. And being violent ill, and in great Extremity of Pain, I was deliver'd in the Kitchen. I never saw the Child move, nor never laid Hands on it; but it got that Bruise on the Head by falling from me, and then in a fright I took it up and carried it to the Vault. Court. Read the Statute the 21st of K. James the I. Chap. 27. Clerk Reads . Whereas many lewd Women, that have been deliver'd of bastard Children, to avoid their Shame, and to escape Punishment, do secretly bury or conceal the Death of their Children, and after, if the Child be found Dead, the said Women do alledge, that the said Child was born Dead; whereas it falleth out sometimes (although hardly it is to be proved) that the said Child or Children were murther'd by the said Women, their lewd Mothers, or by their Assent or Procurement: For the preventing therefore of this great Mischief, be it enacted by the Authority of this present Parliament, That if any Woman, after one Month next ensuing the End of this Session of Parliament, be deliver'd of any issue of her Body, Male or Female, which being born alive should, by the Laws of this Realm, be a Bastard, and that she endeavour privately, either by drowning or secret burying thereof, or any other way, either by herself or the procuring of others, so to conceal the Death thereof, as that it may not come to Light, whether it were born alive or not, but be conceal'd. In every such case, the said Mother so offending shall suffer Death as in Cases of Murder, except such Mother can make proof, by one Witness at least, that the Child (whose Death was by her so intended to be conceal'd) was born dead ? The Jury found her Guilty . Death ."
1731-07-14,,1.0,1.0,"437. Elizabeth Harrard , of Isleworth , was indicted, for that she being big with a certain Male Child, the said Male Child she did, alone, and secretly, bring forth alive, and which Male Child, by the Laws of this Realm, was a Bastard. And she not having GOD before her Eyes, &c. as soon as the said Male Bastard Child was born, with Force and Arms, on the said Male Bastard Child, so alive, feloniously, &c. did make an Assault, and with both her Hands, the said Child, into a certain River, called the Powder-Mills River, did cast and throw, by reason of which casting and throwing into the said River, the said Child was suffocated and drowned, of which Suffocating and Drowning it instantly died , July 10 . She shas likewise charged, by vertue of the Coroner's Inquest, for the said Murder. John Thackery . I am Beadle of Isleworth : On Saturday the 14th of July, Mr. Ions, a Farmer there, found a young Child in the Powder-mills River, and I was ordered to go and fetch it. I went, and saw the Child in a Meadow, covered with a little Grass. It had been taken out of the River before I came, and did not seem to be swelled, or to have any Water in its Body; but on the left side of the Head it had had a Blow; the Blood was congealed, and the Place was so soft, that I could have thrust my Finger into the Scull: I took it to the Stock-house, and on Monday the Overseers of the Poor sent to Mr Wright, the Coroner, for Letters to bury it. While they were gone, a Woman came to me, and told me she suspected the Prisoner, who worked in the Gardens, and gathered Fruit. I went after her, but did not take her; the Overseers of Teddington brought her to us, and our Churchwardens ordered me to get her a Bed, because she was not in a fit Condition to be sent to Newgate. On Wednesday the Coroner sat on the Body, and he ordered me to shew it to the Prisoner. She begged I would not bring it near her, for (said she) 'tis my own Child, - born of my own Body. I asked her how she could tell That, unless she saw it? She said, it was, and she was very sorry for it: But she did not see it, nor would she suffer me to open the Coffin. When she was first brought to us, we told her under what Circumstances we found the Child, and she did not then say any Thing to it; but on Thursday Night I sat up with her, and in the Middle of the Night she asked me, if I had been to see after John Gadd? I told her no, I did not know him. She said he was at Drayton; that he went there last Monday, and had taken a Field of Wheat to reap; that she was with him last Sunday Night, and was to have met him again had she not been taken. Elizabeth Nell , Midwife. When the Prisoner was taken, I was sent to examine her. I asked her if she had had a Child? She said, yes; she was delivered on the Monday before, in a Field as she was going over a Style, and some Men coming by, she went away and left the Child behind. I told her, that Story did not appear feasible, and asked her if it was born alive? She said it was not: And I reply'd I was sure it was born alive by its Head; for it was very much bruised and swelled, and the Blood was congeal'd, which I apprehend it would not have been, had it been born dead. After I had told her I was a Midwife, and it would be better for her to tell me the Truth; she said - then, Mrs. Midwife, I will tell you the Truth: - The Child was born alive, and liv'd a Quarter of an Hour, but as she was sitting in Pain by the River-side, with the Child in her Lap, it rolled out of her Lap into the Water. I asked her again, how long it liv'd, and what she wrapp'd it in? She said, it lived half an Hour; that she tore a Piece of her Apron to wrap it, and that it had been dead half an Hour, or an Hour before she threw it in. I enquired of her, if she had made any Preparation for its being born? She told me, she had two Caps given her, but she had given them away again. The Child was brought to my House, before they carried it to the Cage; and I plainly saw its Death was occasioned by the Bruise on the Head, for no Water appeared in it, and it was very fresh when I first saw it. Elizabeth Thackery . When the Prisoner was taken, she was carry'd to the Sign of the Bell; I went thither and ask'd her, if she was the unfortunate poor Creature that had had a Child? Yes, (she said) and it was found drown'd. I enquired of her, who was the Father of it? She told me, - John Gadd was the Father, and that she was not marry'd to him, but she had lived with him in an odd Manner, a Year and a half, and had miscarr'yd of a Child, by him, once before. She said, she was very poor, and was delivered of this Child as she was going over a Style: That it was born alive, and she heard it cry a little, but she had nothing to wrap it in, except a Bit of her old Apron, and she was so very ill, she did not know what to do with herself. She said, John Gadd was a very wicked Fellow, and she did not know but he might make away with it, tho' she just before had told me, - that she, herself, put it into the Water, and she did not say any thing was done to it, before she put it in. I saw the Bruise on the Side of the Head. The Midwife. 'Tis not impossible that Bruise might be given it, by throwing it into the Water. Prisoner. I went to Richmond to see for Work, and when I got there, I fell in Travel, and sat down for two Hours to ease my Pains. While I was there, the Beadle of Richmond came to me; I asked him for the Help of some good Women. He threatened me, and brought me cross the Water; then he called me Bitch, and bid me shift for myself. So I went to Twickenham, and there likewise I was refused Relief, and the Beadle of that Place, led me out of that Town, and left me in the Fields; where I was so bad, that I was almost dead, and did not know whether my Baby was dead or alive. The Midwife. She did say something to me, about the Beadle of Richmond refusing her Help. Samuel Goodwin . The Day the Coroner sat on the Child, the Prisoner told me, that no Person was with her when she was delivered, but this John Gadd, whom I have often seen with her, under my Haycocks. She likewise said, That a Quarter of an Hour after she had been delivered, John Gadd took her Apron from under her Head, and having tore a Piece off, he wrapped the Child in it, and went away, and she never had seen him since. Guilty , Death ."
1732-04-19,,1.0,,"128. + Hannah Perfect was indicted, and the Indictment sets forth, that on the 27th of January , being big with a certain Male Child, in the Parish of Holy Trinity ; and she not having the Fear of God before her Eyes, and being moved by the Instigation of the Devil, on the said Male Bastard Child, did feloniously and wilfully make an Assault, and in a certain quilted Petticoat did, with both her Hands, wrap or hide, then and there feloniously, wilfully did suffocate and strangle . Q. to Mary Millet . What is it you know in Relation to this Charge of Hannah Perfect 's murdering her Bastard Child? Millet. I don't know the Child was born alive. Court. Give an Account of what you know in Relation to this Child; What Employment do you follow? Millet. I am Servant in the same House where the Prisoner lived. Q. What was the Prisoner in that House? Millet. She was Kitchen Girl , Sir. Q. Do you know any thing of her being with Child? Millet. Nothing at all, Sir; we did not know that she was with Child. Q. What is it you know in Relation to this Matter? Millet. I don't know any thing relating to the Murder. Q. Did you know at any Time, or when she was with Child? Millet. No, Sir. Q. What is it you know of a Child being wrapped up in a Petticoat? Millet. I know I went up Stairs a little before Nine; I don't know the Day of the Month, it was of a Tuesday. Q. How long ago was it? In what Month Mrs Millet? Millet. It was about a Month ago last Tuesday, I went up Stairs in the Room where she lay. Q. Had she been ill before that, or kept her Bed? Millet. No, when I went up to her, I asked her what was the Matter, and she said nothing at all to me; and I was very much surprized and came down Stairs, and went and fetched the Midwife. Q. Did you perceive any thing that made you to think a Midwife was necessary? Millet. Yes, Sir. Q. What was that? Millet. I thought by what I did see, there must be a Child. Q. Had you this Thought by what you observed upon the Prisoner, or by what you observed in Relation of any Linnen or Bed? Millet. By what I observed on the Bed, and in the Room too. Court. Well, you went to call the Midwife, and did she come? Millet. Yes, the Midwife came and found the Child. Q. What was that Child found in? Millet. It was laid in an old Petticoat under the Head of the Bed. Q. Was you present when the Midwife took out the Child? Millet. Yes, Sir. Q. Is the Midwife here? Millet. Yes, Sir. Q. What is her Name? Millet. Mary Bland . Q. Was the Prisoner confined up Stairs before that Day? Millet. No, Sir. Q. What Time was this ? Millet. It was about Nine o'Clock at Night. Q. Whose Servants were you and the Prisoner? Millet. Mr Smith's that keeps the Dog-Tavern on Garlick Hill. Q. Do you know any thing further? Millet. Nothing at all. Court. Then you saw nothing but Marks of Blood upon the Linnen and Floor, did you? Millet. No, Sir. Q. Did you observe the Child whether there were any Marks of Violence? Millet. No, Sir. Mary Bland was the next and only Witness besides, but being a Quaker she would not take an Oath, therefore was not admitted as an Evidence. Q. to Mary Millet , the former Witness. Was you present while Mary Bland examined this Child? Did you and she examine the Child together ? Millet. Yes, Sir. Q. Could you form any Kind of Judgment whether this Child had been alive? Millet Really, Sir, I cannot tell that indeed. Q. At that Time what was the best of your Judgment, whether the Child was born alive or dead. Millet. To the best of my Judgment the Child might have been born alive, but for want of proper Assistance to be sure the Child could not live long. Court. Then you cannot take it upon you to say whether the Child was or was not born alive. Millet. I can't indeed, Sir Court. You don't know she was with Child, or this was the Child she was delivered of? nor you don't know whether she was actually delivered of any Child ? Millet. Sir, I cannot say, I was not in the Room with her. Court. Nor you can't certainly say by these Marks you saw, that she was delivered of a Child? Millet. I could not be sure, but I thought it must be so by what I did see. Court. You did not discover this Child at the Head of the Bed till the Midwife came, did you? Millet. I was in a great Fright, and I did not look for it. Q. In what Condition was the Prisoner, was she in her Senses? Millet. I think she was not in her right Senses. Q. Was there any Behaviour at that Time that induced you to think she was crazy? Millet. I think the Nature of a Woman, except she was out of her Senses, would not make away or destroy her own. Q. Did you talk to her at that Time? Millet. She talked to no Body, nor gave no Body any Answer. Q. What Time might it be between your going up first, and the coming of the Midwife ? Millet.

1733-12-05,,1.0,,"82. (M.) Sarah Clayton , single woman , was indicted for the murder of her female bastard infant, by casting it into a certain pond of water , in the grounds of Samuel Page , Jan. 31 . ++ Henry Webb . I first saw an infant child dead in the pond of Mr. Samuel Page , at Ruslet, on the 30th of January: I was with a team of horses, and went away about my business. I did not see it taken out; it was frozen in with the ice. Q. Was you examined before the coroner? Webb. I was. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? Webb. I do. Q. What is her character? Webb. A very good one; she lived with Mr. Page, and went to live with him last Michaelmas. Cross Examination. Q. What time of the day was this? Webb. It is the fore part of the day. Q. How far is this pond from Mr. Page's house? Webb. It was about a dozen poles off. Mary Groves . I took the child out of the water on the 30th of January. Q. Was it a male or female child? M. Groves. A female Q. Do you live in the neighbourhood? M. Groves. I do; I never had any suspicion of the prisoner being big before the child was found. Mary Parrot . As I was going by the road I heard the water in that pond flounce, and saw the prisoner go away from the pond. Q. When was this? M. Parrot. This was in January, but I cannot say the day of the month. Q. Was it the same pond where the child was found? M. Parrot. It was. Q. Was it the beginning, or middle, or latter end of January? M. Parrot. That I cannot say. Q. Was it dark or light? M. Parrot. It was some time of the day; it was light, but I cannot tell what time of the day. Q. Did you see what made that flounce in the water? M. Parrot. No. Samuel Page . I know there was a child found in my pond near my house; the prisoner was my servant . Q. Did you see the child in the pond? Page. I did, on the 30th of January; it would have floated, had it not been frozen in with the ice. I had occasion on the 31st of December to go into the garret, and looking through where the prisoner lay, I was surprised at seeing a large quantity of blood on the floor. I went down stairs, and told my mother immediately, and said, I was afraid a murder had been committed in the house. She went up stairs, and came down and told me she was afraid so too. I know nothing more than by hear-say. Q. Is she here? Page. No; she is a very ancient woman, and it is dangerous to bring her here. After this I perceived the prisoner to grow visibly less. Q. Are you a married man? Page. I am, but my wife was not then at home. Q. Did you suspect the prisoner? Page. Yes; she had not been in the house a fortnight before we suspected her, and had been with us from the day after Michaelmas, O. S. Cross Examination. Q. What character had you with her? Page. An extreme good one, and she behaved like a good servant. Q. Whether she did not do her work as usual? Page. Yes, she went about her work as usual; but I observed an alteration in her countenance. Q. Did the blood appear to be fresh? Page. It appeared to be done that night. Q. to Mrs. Groves. Did the child appear to be fresh thrown into the pond, or to have been there a month? Mrs. Groves. It bled fresh at the nose. Q. to Page. Did any body examine under the bed, or in the bed? Page. My wife did, I believe. Sarah Page . I was at London the last day of the old year, and when I came home the house was in great confusion, upon the sight of that blood. I asked my mother what was the matter. She said, the old story; that was from the suspicion we had of the girl's being with child. Then my husband ask'd the prisoner if she had been at supper, if not, he bid her to take it, and go to bed. My husband went to bed, that was because my mother should have an opportunity to tell me all about it. Q. Did she go about her business as usual? Mrs. Page. She did. Q. Had you any other servant? Mrs. Page. No other but a man. Then my mother said she was in hopes it was but a miscarriage; there had been something. The next morning I look'd into the room, and it had been mopped; but I saw streaks of blood down the wall, and on the floor. Q. What quantity of blood might there appear to be by the marks? Mrs. Page. There might be a hundred large spots of blood. I look'd on the ground under the window; it was scratched about with a broom, but I saw no blood there, so we were in hopes it was but a miscarriage. We did not care to take the girl's character away; something of that nature there had been to be sure. Cross Examination. Q. Had you the girl examined on that? Mrs. Page. No; we were careful of taking her character away. Q. Did the girl continue with you? Mrs. Page. We kept her till the coroner was there. She was a good servant. She dined at our table, and used to say she was as well as ever she was in her life. The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence, but called the following witnesses. Hannah West . The prisoner lived servant with me three years; she was a very sober, civil, modest girl, and went from me to Mr. Page's. Q. Did she appear to be with child at the time she went from you? H. West. Not as I know of. Mrs. Taylor. I am a midwife, and by the justice of the peace's order was obliged to search the prisoner after the child was found, on the 2d of February. Q. If she had had a child about the latter end of December, do you think you should have discovered it? Mrs. Taylor. I think I should; there were no marks of her ever having a child. I am very sure if she had had a child I should have known it, for I thoroughly searched her. Acquitted ."
1734-04-24,,1.0,,"141. (M.) Sarah Church , single woman , was indicted for the wilful murder of her male child , April the 7th . She stood likewise charged on the Coroner's Inquest for the said murder. || Elizabeth Bowman . I am a midwife. The prisoner was servant to Mrs. Keith: I was sent for after the child was born on the 7th of April: The child was taken out of a trunk and laid upon a large chest; it had no marks of violence upon it; it was in a flannel petticoat. I asked, why she did not send for me before? She said, because her mistress had bolted her into her room, and the child was born at two in the morning. Had it been a married woman's case, I should not have been surprized to have found the woman and child both dead. Q. Was it born alive? E. Bowman. I cannot tell that. It might have died before it came into the world. She had made provision for it. [ The baby things produced.] Q. Had the child gone its full time? E. Bowman. It had. Mary Keith . I live at Chelsea. The prisoner was my servant for three months. I did not believe she was with child; I had too good an opinion of her. I saw some blood in the room, and I suspected she had had a child. I said, I am afraid there is something in the trunk that should not be. I asked for the key. She gave it me. I then went to a neighbour, and told her; she desired I would not open the trunk till the constable came. When he came we opened it; we found the child at the bottom of it; but I did not examine it, it was a boy; but I am no judge whether it had gone its full time or not. Q. Did you bolt her into her room? M. Keith. I did, as she said, she was very sick, because she should not be disturbed. Q. Did you hear her call in the night? M. Keith. No. I did not. I charged her with being with child, but she never would own it. Sarah Clark . I live at Newington in Surry. I was at Chelsea about the time this woman was brought to bed. I came just as the constable came. I saw the child in a petticoat; it was under some linen in a box: it was taken out of the box, and put upon a chest. I saw no marks of violence upon it. Q. Had it gone its full time? S. Clark. I do not know that; neither do I know whether it was born alive. I think it might have been smothered in the bed at the time of the birth for want of proper help. She said, it was born about two o'clock. James Wright . I am the constable. I was sent for to open the trunk. I found a dead child in a bit of linen rag, wrapped in a piece of an old petticoat; we took it out and laid it on a chest. I asked the prisoner, how she came to put it there? She said, she was brought to bed about two o'clock, and did not come to herself till about five; she found it dead, and so she put it in her trunk, because her mistress had said, if she was brought to bed there, she would throw her and the child into the street. I found some child-bed linen in the trunk. It might be born alive, but might have died for want of help. Alexander Reed . I opened the body of the child, and took out the lungs, and made the usual experiment, and found they swam, which shews it had breathed: but it might have been smothered without her having done any thing to it; there was no appearance of any mark or outward design to destroy it. I look upon it, it died for want of proper assistance. E. Bowman. I parted the navel string, &c. Prisoner's Defence. The reason I did not own I was with child was, because I intended to go to my aunt's to lie-in: I intended to have gone away the next day. The reason I put the child in the trunk was, because my mistress had said, if I was brought to bed there, she would throw me and the child in the street. When I was delivered and came to myself, I found it dead. I called out, but nobody heard me; I was spent so much at last that I could call no more. For the Prisoner. Mr. Wilson, with whom she had lived almost five months, gave her the character of a sober, honest, diligent person. Acquitted ."
1735-01-16,,1.0,,"11. Elizabeth Ambrook , was indicted for the Murder of her male Bastard Infant, by throwing it, as soon as born, out of a Window 2 Stories high, in the House of William Ambrook , upon the Tiles covering a Shed adjoining to the said House, and thereby giving the said Bastard one Mortal Bruise on the left Side of the Head, of which mortal Bruise he instantly dyed , December 28 . She was a second time indicted on the Coroner's Inquisition for the said Murder. Samuel Cook . Standing at my Garden-Door in Crown-Alley in upper Moorfelds , on Saturday, about four in the Afternoon, I heard the Noise of a Window clapping to; upon which I went into the Garden and saw something lye upon Mr. Clark's Shed which joins to William Ambrook's House. I could not guess what it was, but I poked it down and laid it in the Alley, and then I perceiv'd that it was a New-born Child. I believe there was some Life in it, for I thought I saw the Body move. Several People came round it presently, and I staid four or five Minutes, or perhaps a Quarter of an Hour, and then it was taken away, and as I understood, was carried to the Watch-house. It was a Male Child. There is a Window over the Shed where I found the Child. Ann Ambrook . The Prisoner is my Husband's Sister. She came to our House about Noon, and said she was extreamly ill for want of a Stool. I gave her some Stuff to make her go to stool, and then undrest her, and put her to Bed. I went up two Hours after, and found her standing upright in the Bed with her two Arms thus. She said she was almost distracted for want of a Stool - I went up again at half an Hour past three, and then she said she was better and I saw no more of her till after the Misfortune; for about four I heard that a Child was flung out of the Window, but I did not go to see the Child till Monday, and then I saw it in the Watch-house. Nor did I go up to the Prisoner till the Constable came, and that was about five o'Clock. I found things in a disorderly Condition, with the Signs of a Delivery by the Bed-side. I had no Notion of her being with Child till I heard of a Child being thrown out of the Window, and then I concluded it must be hers, for the Room where she was has a Window that looks out upon the Shed where the Child was found. I asked her how she came to do such a thing, and she said, she did not know she did, for thro' the Extremity of Pain she thought the Room was on Fire when she threw it out - Before she came to our House, she lived a Servant in the next Alley which is White-Cross Alley, with Mr. Pomeroy a Watch Maker. Peter Debrather , Constable. I am an English Man born and bred, but I have been a great many Years out of the Land, and dont very well understand English, but I will speak so well as I can. As I was into my Garden, I heard the People in the Alley, and one said, Pray come and see the Cruelness in this Alley; so I went, and looked upon my Watch, and it was half an Hour after four, and the People surrounded me, and pull'd me, and said, Why don't you search for the Mother? Whereup, I fetch my short staff, and charge this Gentlewoman, Sarah Newman , to aid and assist; and so we went to Ann Ambrook's Door, and she said, You need not go any further, for here it is to my Sorrow. I asked her, where? and she told me above. Whereup, I being quicker than the Women, went up first, but I see such a Sight, that I run down so fast as I came up - and running down four or five Pair of Stairs. Court. Four or five Pair of Stairs? Debrather. I dont know how to call it, but it was four or five Steps - and then call'd in the two Women, Ann Ambrook and Sarah Newman, and put them forwards, and left them in the Room to take care of the Prisoner, while I went to the Church-Warden, and he brought a Midwife to the Prisoner. Joel Fremoult , Surgeon. The Church-Wardens of Shoreditch Parish sent for me to view the Child on Monday Evening; there was a large Contusion in the left side of the Head; I took off the Scalp, and found a large Quantity of extravastated and congeal'd Blood; there was no Fracture, for the Scull of so tender a Child is not properly Bone, but rather Grisle; but there was a Prohiberance in the Scull it self where the Bruise was: which I believe was the Cause of its death. Susan Anderson . I was at Mr. Pomeroy's House last Saturday, and there was the Prisoner's Sister who broke open the Prisoner's Trunk, in which we found this Child-bed Linnen. Margaret Warner . I was there at the same time, and saw this Linnen taken out. The Prisoner's Sister and Pomeroy's Maid produced a Key with which the Trunk was opened, but it was with a great deal to do. Susan Anderson, again. There was a Key put into the Lock, but it would not open it, and so it was forced open with a File. Then the Statute on which the Prisoner was Indicted, was read by order of Court. The Jury found the Prisoner Guilty . Death ."
1735-09-11,,1.0,1.0,"491. + Eleanor Scrogham , of St Margaret, Westminster , Spinster , was indicted, for that she on the 13th of September , in the 17th Year of His Majesty's Reign, being big with two Male Children; she on the said 13th of September, the said two Male Children, by the Providence of God, privately and secretly did bring forth alive; which said two Male Children, by the Laws of this Land, are Bastards; and that she the said Eleanor Scrogham , not having God, &c. on the said 13th of Sept. as soon as the said two Male Bastard Children were born, in and upon the said two Male Bastard Children, did make an Assault, and the said two Male Bastard Children, she the said Eleanor Scrogham , feloniously, wilfully, and of her Malice aforethought, in both her Hands did take, and the said two Male Bastard Children being alive, out of her Hands into a Necessary-House did cast and throw, by which casting and throwing, into the Necessary-House aforesaid, and by Reason of the Filth and Excrement therein, the said two Mare Bastard Children were suffocated; of which Suffocation they instantly died; and that the said Eleanor Scrogham , the said two Male Bastard Children did kill and murder . She was a second Time charged on the Coroner's Inquisition for the said Murder. Diddle Webster . The Prisoner was my Servant , and she was out of Town with me at Stanmore where I lived; she was taken ill, and said she believed she was nearer her Time than I thought for; I sent her to Town before me. When I came to Town I found she had been Ill; - I had taxed her with being with Child in the Country ||; she at first denied it, and then she said she was *; and that she was married, and had three Months to go. || Mrs Webster was so affected she could scarce express herself for Tears. * The Statute 21 Jac I. c. 27. [inserted in the former Part, p. 277] doth not make a new Offence, but maketh a Concealment to be an undeniable Evidence of the Murder; but the Party confessing herself with Child beforehand is not within the Statute, as was determined on the following Case: Ann Davis was tried at the Aug. 31. 1664, (before Sir John Kelyng , Knt Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, Sir Orlendo Bridg Knt. Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and Sir William Wyloe , Knt. and Burt Recorder of London) for dering her Male Bastard Child. Upon the Evedence it appeared, That the Prisoner lived in a Chamber by herself, and went to Bed on Thursday Night well, without any Pain, and in the Middle of the Night ked full of Pain, and knocked some body to come to her, and one Woman heard her knock, but came not to her; and the same Night delivered of a Child, and after she put the Child in a Trunk, and did not discover it till Friday Night following. And all this was found specially, to have the of all the Judges, Whether that knocking or Help at the Time of her Travel, (although the conce it after one Day) exampls her from that Statute. For there was no ary Hunt upon the Body of the Child. But thus far it was agreed by us, That if there be an Intent in the Woman to conceal the Chi ld, then it is Murder by that Statue, though Truth the Child was horn: But if there was no Intent to conceal it, or if she confess with Child before hand, and she is surprised and delivered, no body being with her, this is not within the Statute, because there was to conceal it; and therefore in Case, if there be no Sign of Hurt upon the Child, it is no Murder. Reports, p. 32 Q. Did you know what became of the Children? Webster. Not then I did not: I asked her where her Child was, she told me it was safe and alive, and that she had put it out; I asked her where, she said, she had put it to Nurse at the Bull and Gate in Holborn, I enquired after it, but it was not to be found there. Q. Was there any Childbed Linnen provided? Webster. I did not see any, I heard there was some. Q. Was not she to have gone away to have in? Webster. I know no more than I have said. Jane Thomas . Mrs Webster sent for Afternoon about a Month ago; said she, I, upon a Maid, brought but now she was the at the Bull and Gate in Holborn; we went but it was not to be found. When I came back, I to Mrs Webster, I will ask Question, do you go out of the Room, and me more readily; said I, Sweeth if the Child; said I, I hope you have your Child (for I had a that she had put under the Copper) No, Madam, said she, I have not. I asked her, what she had done with it; said I, I hope you have not murdered it; No, Madam, said she; said I, is the Child in the Vault, she said it was; that she had a Desire to go to the Vault, and that it dropped from her when she was there; we got the Vault searched, and as God would have it, the last Child came up first. I said to the Men that was searching the Vault, (after he had taken up one Child,) young Man, there another Child. - Upon my Oath, I said so to him; I said to the Prisoner, are they both together? Did you throw them down? She said, No, indeed, I did not; said I, are there two Children; she said, I can't there was a great deal came from me, and I was in such Extreme of Pain that if I had had ten thousand Worlds, I could not got off the Vault; and I know that when Women are in such Distress of Pain they cannot stir to help themselves. Said I, if you have murdered your Children it is a crying Sin; it is a Sin against the Holy Ghost, and if that is your Case. I should rather die than live. - I have been a Midwife 18 Years. Q. Is it usual for Women to desire to go to the Necessary House when they draw near their Time? Thomas. Yes. - I had a Woman that I attended that stole away from me with that Intent. - I know the first Child had never been handled by any Hand to part them, because we have a particular Method that we know that by, and I believe her Pains were so violent that she could not go from the Place. I know when Women are in the Birth they can neither stand nor go. I asked her why she not call some People; she said she thought Re she should be better. Q. Were the Children at their full Growth? Thomas. I cannot say that they were; no Woman in England can swear to a Month in the Birth of a Child; - she declared, before the Justice, that not made any Child-bed Linnen, but that her Sister Orders to make some, and that she there to lie in. Margaret Oldfield . I got up that Night to wash about twelve o'Clock, and I heard such a Scream that I was frightened out of my Wits; (I am a Servant, and live over against Mrs Webster's said I, to the Washer-Woman, I believe Mrs Webster's Maid is in Labour, and there is no body in the House, and if some Body does not go to her Assistance she will be lost; (I think it was the 13th of September) I knocked at the Door as loud as I could knock, and called with my knocking, and she screamed out at the same Time, but did not come to the Door; and about eight o'Clock in the Morning I saw her open the Windows; I asked her what was the Matter, that she screamed out so? She said, she was taken with the Cramp, and the Cholick; she said, she went to Bed about ten o'Clock; I asked her why she did not come down Stairs; she said, she could not have come down Stairs for all the World - to the best of my Knowledge the streaming came out of the Room where she lay, up three Pair of Stairs. Q. Was it known that she was with Child ? Oldfeild. Yes, it was known. Thomas Ayers . I was sent for to search Mrs Webster's Vault; I searched a little while, and I found one Child; then I took off the Top of the Vault, and made a larger Search, and found another Child. - As to whose Children they were, I cannot tell; they were supposed to be the Children of the Prisoner at the Bar. Thomas Ball . On the 14th of September I was at the Examination of the Prisoner; and found, by her Examination, that there was a Child in the Vault; I fetched the last Witness to help me Search for it, and we found a Child: When the Midwife saw it, she said, there was another; and after a further Search I took that up. - Bennet. The Prisoner's Sister lodges at my House, and I saw her make several Things fit for a Child; the Prisoner was to lie in at my House; I had a Bed ready at a Minute's Warning. Ann Scrogham . The Prisoner is my Sister-in-Law; she had made Provision for the Child; these are the Things; she was to have lain-in at Mrs Bennet's. - I made the Things by the Prisoner's Order. Robert Simmonds . I am a Practitioner in Midwifry. Q. I would ask whether it is usual with Women, when the Time of Child-bed draws near, to have a violent Inclination to go to the Vault? Simmonds. It is very common; and it is a common Prognostick of an approaching Birth. Q. Is it not possible, when a Women is in that Condition, for the Child to fall from her? Simmonds. Yes, to be fare. Jury. Where did your Servant lie ? Webster. In the Garret. Acquitted . The Jury found, on the Coroner's Inquisition, that the Children were still-born."
1736-12-08,,1.0,,"366. (M.) Sarah Hunter , spinster , was indicted for the wilful murder of her male bastard child . She good charged on the coroner's inquest for the said murder, May 5 . || Ann Richards . I am servant to Mrs. Steer at Edmonton . The prisoner was servant in the same family: she was the cook . I came to live there the 4th of May, between three and four in the afternoon. The prisoner was taken ill in the evening. She went up stairs about nine. I went up between ten and eleven in the same room. I found the prisoner sitting on the side of her bed. She complained she was very ill, so that I did not go to bed. She complained of her leg swelling, and said she was very full of pain across her joins and back. I thought it proper she should have assistance. I went into mistress's room, and desired she would get up. She did; mistress gave her something to drink; I believe it was brandy. Seeing her so bad, we thought proper she should have a surgeon. We sent for Mr. Abel, a man-mid wife: this might be between twelve and one in the night. The prisoner got into bed before he came. He asked her what was the matter with her; she said she was very full of pain; he ordered her a draught and went away, after being there about five or six minutes. She drank the draught; after that she said she found herself better. I left the room and went down stairs. I did not stay long below. Mary Pink that was in the room went down for some water for the prisoner, who said she was very dry. We put some gin in it, and the prisoner drank it. When Mary Pink was gone down, I heard the prisoner make a noise in the bed as if she pulled her pocket from under her pillow; the curtains were drawn, so that I did not see her. This was about a quarter of an hour after Mr. Abel was gone. I heard her make a noise as if moving about in the bed. I thought I heard her open a knife. I heard it clash. This very much shocked me. I had hardly power to stir; I thought she was doing something to herself. She seemed to be very busy under the bedclothes. I went into mistress's room, and told her that I heard her make a noise, and thought I heard her open a knife, and imagined she was going to make use of it. Then I went back again; the prisoner then seemed to be pretty easy; she seemed to compose herself, and desired us to go to bed. This was betwixt one and two. Pink went to bed; I sat on the side of the bed where Mary Pink lay, and do not know that I spoke to the prisoner till morning. I did not go to sleep till after day-light. During the time I sat I think the prisoner drank one draught which I had put in a bottle at her desire, and put it on her bed. I went to bed about four, and slept till about eight; then I got up and went down stairs. When I awaked, the prisoner was in bed, she seemed to be asleep; but I said nothing to her, nor she to me. I carried her up a bason of tea about nine; she drank it, then I think she was sitting on the side of the bed. She got up and made the man's bed in the garret by herself. She came down, and began making her own bed; I came up at the time, and assisted in putting the blankets on. She had changed her sheets, and got a pair of clean ones. I went and told mistress of the clean sheets; then my mistress and I went up into the room. We saw the foul ones, and then we began to think something. Then the prisoner was go: down stairs; there was an appearance on the foul sheets, as if she had been brought to bed. We found them in the drawer. I did not see the child till after it had been seen by other people, about the middle of the day. After we found the sheets, mistress came down and desired the prisoner to go to bed. Mrs. Ann Steer . I live at Edmonton. The prisoner was my cook four months. On the first of May she complained of her legs swelling very much. I saw them on the fourth: they were very much swelled. I then had not the least suspicion of her being with child, having at that time a very good opinion of her. I was going out of town, so I desired her to keep her legs on a chair. When I came home about ten, she was gone to bed. I went to bed also about eleven; and just as I was got into bed, my servant came and told me the prisoner was very bad, and desired I would come to her. I put my under petticoat and bed-gown on, and went and asked her how she did; she said she was in such pain in her stomach and all round, that she did not know what to do. I gave her some pepper-mint water. I did not suspect then that she was with child. She continued in pain. After that I ventured to give her some gin. I told her, I thought her very bad, and that I durst not give her any thing else. I said I would send for Mr. Abel. He lives but a few doors distant. She desired I would not, saying she was out of order, and was sure she should be better. I sent my maids out of the room, and hoped to make some discovery. Then I told her I was frightened very much at her, that I had a great opinion of her, otherwise I should not know what to think. She gave no answer, but seemed ignorant of what I aimed at. I did not mention any thing farther. She had told me before she had had a long illness two or three years ago. I asked her whether she was as bad now as she was then: she said she never was so bad as she was now; and added, in her illness before, her mistress gave her strong things that made her almost drunk. She said the drinking of gin had done her good, and that she was much better, and begged I would go to bed. I said I was so uneasy about her, I could not think of going to bed, and that I would send for Mr. Abel. I did so, and directed he should not go up till I had seen him. She said there was no occasion for him. When Mr. Abel came, I went down and told him my suspicions, and desired him to question her. He went up stairs, and asked her a great may questions, which I cannot particularize. I was by at the time. He stayed with her about five minutes. She did not appear worse. He told her he would send her a draught. I went down with him, and asked him what he thought. He said he thought she was in labour. I saw her a great many times that night. He desired me to charge her with it. I told him, if he would stay a little, I would go up again to her, and hear more what she said. I went up, and sat down by her, and told her I was very uneasy and frighted at her, and could not tell what was the matter with her. She asked me if Mr. Abel was below. I said, Yes. She asked what was the reason he did not go, she could not think why he stayed so long; adding, that there was no occasion for him to stay. I told her he stayed to see how she did. I went down and told him what I had said, and that I had not courage to say any more to her. I told him if he would go home and prepare her a draught, I would send a person for it, and that there should be no bad consequence, she should not be left alone a moment. When the draught came, I went and gave it her. She then seemed better, and said she was very sleepy, and begged I would go to bed, for I should get cold without my cloak. She seemed then a little easier, yet I could discover she had little pains now and then. She pressed me very much to go to bed. I told her I would, but insisted upon it my maids should stay by her. I was not satisfied with this, but told them by no means to leave her. They promised me they would not. Then I went to bed. As soon as I got into bed, one of them came and knocked at the door, and said the cook wanted a little water. I told her she might fetch a little, but she must put some brandy in it to take the rawness off of it, and bid her make all the haste she could. I believe in about a minute after Ann Richards came, exceedingly frighted, and said, For God's sake, madam, come to the cook; I don't know what she is doing, she is doing something to herself: she has got her pocket in the bed, and I think she has taken her knife out; I heard it clash; and she is very busy under the bed-clothes. I sent her back again directly; my daughter was in bed with me; I desired her to go to the door and hear if she heard any noise. She came back again and said the cook lay very still and quiet. She heard nothing. I lay till about four. I was very fearful the maids were gone to sleep, hearing no stir. I sent my daughter to see. She came again, and said the maids were laid down in their clothes, and the cook was snoaring. I lay till six: then I went into the room, and found the cook fast asleep. I then went to the other bed, and waked the other two. My room is close by theirs. I desired them to get up: they said they had stayed some time by her, that she slept very well, and they thought they need not stay any longer, therefore they lay down. I desired them to call my daughter as they came through my room. This was between seven and eight. I asked them how the cook did when they came; they said she was not got up. As soon as I was dressed, I went into her room, which was about a quarter of an hour after eight, and asked her how she did. She said she was a great deal better, but she was so much out of order, she was afraid to move. I said I hoped she was no worse than common. She said, No. I desired she would stay in her room, and I would go down and make some tea, and send it up. I sent her a bason of tea up. I said I was certain there was something more than ordinary, she looked so shockingly. She came down a little after nine into the kitchen. One of my daughters came and told me the cook wanted clean sheets, for she was going to wash her foul ones: they were very dirty. I bid my daughter give her a pair, but would not let her wash the others. I sent Ann Richards up to help her to make her bed, as I heard she was going to make it. I went up, and saw them both putting the blankets on. I looked about, but saw nothing then. I went down again. When the prisoner came down, I desired my daughter to keep her in the kitchen, while I went up and looked about the house for the foul sheets. I went and looked in the garret, where the foul linen is kept. I could not find them there. I looked under her bed in her room; I found there a blanket, her under petticoat, and a bedgown that I had lent her: though I had not found the sheets, I was satisfied there was something more than ordinary. At last I found the sheets in a corner of a drawer where her things lay: then I was thoroughly satisfied she had had a child. They were bundled up in a very bad condition, I have had many children myself, and was quite sure she had had a child. Then I went to get her out of the kitchen: she was wanting to do some work, but I thought her not in a condition to work. She went up stairs. I went up and kept her in talk the while my daughter tried my keys to see whether any would unlock her trunk in the garret. After that I came down, and consulted my daughter what I should do. I took the chare-woman, who is a married woman, up with me. I first sent her into the room to the prisoner to ask her how she did: then I went in, and said, You look sadly, will you have any thing? She said she thought she was a little saint. I said, Cook, you may very well be saint, for I am sure you have had a child. She denied it at first. I said, Though I was so ignorant last night, I am not now, for I was very certain by what I had seen, and if she would not tell me, I would send for a constable. Then she said, there was a child. I asked her where it was; she said in her trunk in the garret, and gave me her keys out of her pocket. I told her she shocked me very much, and bid her go to bed, as the most decent place for her. I got her into bed, and got her some caudle, went with the chare-woman, and found the child tied up in a handkerchief in a corner of her trunk. The trunk was locked. The chare-woman brought it in her apron into a parlour, which we made but little use of. I did not care any body should know of it then. I saw the child was cut down from the ear, and then another cut across the throat, about two inches long each cut. It was a boy. The cut seemed to be to the bone of the neck. I saw the bone, but did not care to look at it much. It seemed very deep. It was very bloody, and bled very fresh till the Monday. This was Friday. The handkerchief was very bloody in which it was. I sent the chare-woman to tell her, I thought she had murdered her child, and I could not see her any more. Q. Did it seem to be a full grown child? Mrs. Steers. It did; it appeared as if she had gone her full time. Eliz. Low. I am a chare-woman. Mrs. Steers sent for me. She went up stairs and I along with her. This was after the sheets and things were found. We went up to search for the child. I went to the prisoner and asked her how she did; she said, she was very poorly. Madam came up a little after; we then went up into the garret. Madam said, she was certain there must be a child by the things she had seen. The prisoner denied it at first, but not much; afterwards she owned it. Madam asked her for the keys; she gave them to her. Then we went up into the garret, and found the child in the prisoner's trunk. It was very bloody, so also was the handkerchief in which it was. The child bled fresh then from the neck, where there was a wound. It was cut down the neck and cross the neck. I saw the bone. I staid with the prisoner three nights, she never said any thing to me. Mrs. Steers. I bid this chare-woman to ask the prisoner for her pocket, thinking she was not fit to have a knife. She gave her her knife out of her pocket, but that was not bloody. Q. What growth was the child. E. Low. It was at its full time. I have had children. It was tied up in a snuffy linen handkerchief. Q. to Mrs. Steers. Had she made any preparation to put the child in? Mrs. Steers. The prisoner sent me word, if I would look into her trunk, I should find some child's things. I looked in her trunk, and there I found a neckcloth for a child, that was formerly used about a child's neck: that I found on the Friday. She was taken away on the Monday in the afternoon. (Produced in Court.) E. Low. There was a linen cloth, that seemed to have been made for a clout, wrapped about the child's head in the handkerchief. Barthelomew Abel. I am a man-midwife. I was sent for to Mrs. Steers's, at about eleven o'clock at night, on the 4th of May. Mrs. Steers told me she was exceedingly frighted about her cook. She had lived with her about four months, and was a very good servant, or else she should suspect something was the matter more than ordinary. I asked her if she thought her with child. She said she looked big, but not bigger than she was at her coming. She informed me, she had not been regular for the time she had been there; but would not have me take notice to her that I suspected her to be with child, but go up and have some talk with her. She was cautious of the girl's reputation. We went up stairs together. I asked her several questions, particularly how long since she had been out of order; she told me four months before she came to that place, and that she had been taking some pills, which began to have a proper effect, and that she expected she should soon be better. I looked at one of her legs, and found it very much swelled. I came down stairs. I could not be absolutely certain she was with child, but it was my opinion she was, and that she was in labour. I thought it proper for madam to go and tax her with it. After some little time she went up in order to do it. She came down again and told me, she told her that Mr. Abel thought her much like a woman in labour, but the prisoner said it was a particular time, and asked why I staid; saying, I need not to stay; if she had any occassion, she would send for me. I said I would send her something by way of amusing her, and if they sent for me, I would come directly. I sent a draught, and desired she might not be left alone. I went home, and lay down between the blankets, and fell asleep, and heard nothing till morning; when about nine I went to see how she did. She was then not up. I was told I might go up stairs. I went up, and found her dressed, sitting on the side of the bed. Upon asking her how she did, she told me she was much better, that she had had a considerable alteration, as she used to be at particular times, and was quite easy and free from pain, and should soon be well. As she was up, I looked at her to see whether she was big as usual, but not having seen her before to observe her, I could not tell. I went home. After this Mrs. Steers beckoned me. I went into her house. She told me there was a child found. She and I went up into the garret, and there I saw it. Mrs. Steers. The child had been washed and cleaned, and carried up there when Mr. Abel saw it. Mr. Abel. It was a full grown male child, with a considerable wound on its neck. It was cut straight down the neck, and afterwards across the neck. The first began about two inches or an inch and a half below the right ear, and came down right about two inches or an inch and a half long . It reached to the first bone of the neck. It penetrated quite to the bone, about an inch and a half deep. The other cut across was full two inches long, and full two inches deep. It appeared to have been washed when I saw it. I did not see any blood. Q. Is any thing to be inferred from its fresh bleeding, as Mrs. Steers has given an account, that it was born alive? Abel. No. If it had been born dead, it might have bled. On the Monday the coroner sent to me, and asked if it was necessary to open the child, to find out whether it was born dead or alive. I told him it was a received opinion, if it had been born dead, the lungs would sink, but did not know it was an infallible sign. I took out the lungs and put them in water, and they swam. I don't mention this as an infallible rule. Q. What is your judgement, upon the whole, of the appearance of this child, or can you form any judgement upon it, whether it was born dead or alive? Abel. I would rather think it was born alive. Prisoner's Defence. I awaked in the morning and found there was a child; that frighted me very much. I was not sensible what I did. I can give no account how I did it. To her Character. John Atkins . I have known her upwards of ten years at Newark upon Trent. She lived in many good and genteel families; and always had the good character of an honest sober girl. Acquitted ."

She was a second time indicted on the Coroner's Inquisition for the said Murder. Jasper Pain . The Prisoner and her Husband lodged at my House in Queen Street in April last. On Sunday the thirty first of August, at a Quarter past eight in the Morning, I went down to give my Cat some Victuals, but she flew down into the Cellar, and I followed her, and hearing a Noise in the Vault, I thought she was fallen in there, for I once had a Cat that met with such a mischance. I got a Candle, and looking down I saw something wabbling about, which I thought was the Cat. But my Wife coming down for some Coals, the Cat came and fondled about her, at which she screamed out and said, It is not the Cat in the Vault - I got a piece of an Iron Hoop, which I tyed to a String and put it down, and by moving it about I discovered part of a Child - We got Assistance, and broke up the Vault, put down a Ladder, and a Boy went down and brought up a Child alive; but it died at about five the same Day - I found a Stick in the Vault about seven or eight Foot long. Phebe Webster . I went up to the Prisoner about nine o'Clock. She said the Child came from her on the Vault. I asked her how she could be so barbarous, and why she did not call for help. She answered, Because I was wicked. William Abbot . I went up with the Prisoner's Husband, and he said to her, What a pretty piece of work you have brought upon your self and me; pray to the Lord for the life of the Child - She made no answer. Prisoner. I was taken very ill in the Morning, and thought it had been the Gripes. I got up from my Husband and went down to the Vault, where my Senses went from me, and I did not recover my self, nor know what I did or said - I was under no Temptation of being so barbarous, for I had a good Husband who was able to maintain the Child; and I had at the same time one Child living of four Years old. Phebe Webster . When I first went up she lay upon the Bed and I helped her into bed, and it was two Hours afterwards that I asked her how she could be so barbarous: and she answered, because she was wicked - She indeed was very weak and faint as I thought. Mrs. Morgan. I spoke to her about nine o'Clock, she made no answer, she was seemingly very weak. But I cannot say whether she was out of her Senses or not. Mrs. Bouffet. I went up first about nine o'Clock, when I spoke she made no answer, I drew the Curtains and I pulled her by the Arm, but could find no Sense in her; and so I called up the Midwife, and we thought she was dead. Phebe Webster. I have known Children come away perfectly involuntary and without any Assistance. And by what I observed at the Vault, I found she might have been delivered there. and I observed no sign in any other place. The Jury acquitted her."

I can't tell the Time exactly, when this happened, but one Night, I came home and went to Bed, after I had been out all Day hard at Work; the Prisoner in the Night got upright upon her Knees in the Bed; and I asked her, what she was doing? She told me, she was making use of the Pot. In the Morning I got up to go to my Work, and because the Prisoner had been restless all Night, I innocently went to put the Clothes upon the Bed, to cover her; and under her Gown I saw a Handkerchief; and in the Handkerchief I found a Baby wrapped up. I asked her, why she did not call for Help, when I asked her what she was doing, but she made me no Answer at all . This was about 8 o'Clock in the Morn. ing. - I did not observe whether the Child had received any Hurt in its Body , nor can I tell whether it was at its full Growth. - I never heard it cry.

This was in the Time of the hard Frost; I can't tell what Day it was exactly. After I had seen the Child, I asked, how she came to kill it? She said, she did not kill it; she found it dead, and therefore laid it away from her; and before she would have killed it, she would have gone a-begging with it. I desired her to tell me who was the Father? She said, she could not tell who it was got it, nor where he was, for one of the Men was gone twenty Miles, another thirty, and another four Miles off.

The Prisoner lived a Year and a half in my House, and I never saw any Harm by her in my Life; she always kept good Hours, but as to this Fact, - I did not know she was with Child, nor that she was brought to Bed, till Claxton, (the first Witness) came down Stairs in the Morning, and told me what had happened.

1737-10-12,,1.0,,"600. Jane Trigg . spinster , was indicted for the murder of her female bastard child , July 1 . and she stood charged on the coroner's inquisition for the said murder. William Glover . I live at Sunbury, in Middlesex . My back yard comes against the prisoner's necessary house. On Sunday the first of July I got up about 6 o'clock, and opened my backdoor. I heard a groaning . I had occasion to go into my own necessary house. The time I was there, I heard this groaning continually. Then I went near. I heard a person speaking to the prisoner who was in her necessary house. The prisoner said, I have been prodigious bad all night with the cholic and pain in my bowels. I don't take upon me to swear to the voice ; but I think it was the prisoner. I thought no more of it till a child was found on the Wednesday morning in this necessary house. Then there came William Johnson , Thomas Gunter , John King , and John Hillier , to my house, and desired I'd let them go into my back yard, to see if there was a child in that vault. I had flung a great heap of dirt to keep the filth from coming through. They dug that away. Then they saw a child, I did not go with them; they came and told me what they saw, and desired I'd lend them something to get it out. I lent them a garden how, with which they took it out, and brought it to my house. There was a bruise on one side of the head. It was a female child. It was reported about the town, the prisoner was with child before this. Thomas Gunter and William Johnson deposed to their taking the child out of the Vault, and washing it; and that it was reported some time that the prisoner was with child. Jane Reading . I live under the same roof the prisoner does, I was going to the pump this Sunday morning. I saw the prisoner sitting in the necessary house. She groaned, and said, it was a sad thing to have her bowels so bad. I said, so it is. She got off and went in a-doors. I went out about my business. When I came back again about 8 o'clock, I found the house very still. Some time after her mother came home. I asked her how her daughter did. She said, she was indifferent. After that, I observed the necessary house clean washed. On the Wednesday morning I got a candle and looked down the necessary house, and there I saw a young child lie, then I made it known Richard Stephens . I am a Surgeon, and live at this same town. Hearing a female child was found in a bog house, on Friday the 6th of July, I went to see the child. I did not observe any marks of violence on it. It was a fine full grown child. I opened the chest of it, and took out the right lobe of the lungs, and put it into Water. That induced me to believe the child was born alive ; for that swam. Had the child never breathed, the lungs would have sunk. Q. Is it possible a woman might be deliver'd of such a child as this, by a sudden surprize, while she is sitting on the necessary house? Stevens. It is very improbable. Q. Is it possible? Stevens. I think it is next to impossible. Q. Are you a man-midwife ? Stevens. No, my lord, I am not. Q. Have you never heard of things of this kind coming by surprize? Stevens. No, Sir. Q. Suppose a woman should be taken with violent pains, while sitting in that manner? whether or no a child may not come from her immediately? Stevens. It is very improbable. Q. Does not such sort of disorder occassion the person sometimes to want to go to stool? Stevens. I never heard of such a thing. Q. Did you never hear of a woman going cross a room, and, upon some sudden surprize, bring forth a child directly? Stevens. I never knew an instance of it. Q. to Jane Reading . Was there any thing appeared at that time, that could induce you to believe the prisoner was deliver'd ? J Reading . I saw nothing. Q. Did you hear a child cry? J Reading . I did not. Acquitted ."
1739-09-06,,1.0,,"108. (M.) , a single woman , was indicted for the murder of her female bastard child , Jan. 16 .* John Jones. I live at Knightsbridge , the prisoner was servant to Dr. Clark who lodged in my house: On the 16th of Jan. about three in the morning. I got up in order to go to brewing; I traced some marks of blood from the kitchen stairs to the necessary house, and seeing much blood there, I put down my lanthorn and candle, and discovered a child lying. I got a chissel and iron crow, and wrenched up the floor, and by the help of a dung hook I got the child up; then I and my servant maid went and washed it at the pump; it was a female child; I observed it lay partly on its back with the head buried in the soil. We could see no cuts, or scars, or marks of violence on it. I then carried it and laid it on a table in the back kitchen, and then sent for Mr. Fisher, a surgeon, and a midwife, who is here to give evidence; they came, and I desired they'd inspect the child to see if there was any thing to be found from whence they might imagine that the child came by its death; they searched it in my sight, and declared they found no marks of violence upon it; it seemed to me to be very near its full time. I thought I had seen children newly born more perfect, there being very little hair on its head, and the nails on its fingers not so big as on newborn children I have seen; it was a small child. By the position the child lay in it might have come from her as she sat on the vault, for the head was downwards, and seemed to be a good deal buried in the soil. I also observed what follows the child lying near its feet, or betwixt the legs, and the navel-string was found to be broke, not cut, about five or six inches from the child's body; a good deal of blood had gone down the vault, more than I perceived any where else. Q. Was it drops of blood you had observed on the floor from the stairs? Jones. It was rather smear'd blood that seem'd to be done by a woman's bottom of her petticoats, and I am very well assured it was done by a person returning from the vault, for the blood was daubed against the under part of the stairs, which, had it been done by coming down, would have been on the tops of the stairs; I make no doubt but it was done in the return. I went to Dr. Clark and told him what I had seen, and that I thought it was by somebody belonging to him. The prisoner had complained of a purging on her two or three days before this. Q. Had you any suspicion of the prisoner being big before? Jones. No, I had not. My wife went up stairs to the prisoner, and brought down two or three little things for a child, which she said she had been making at different times when her master was out of the way. Produced in court a shirt, some caps, and other things. I had, after this, some talk with my wife, who said it was possible that the child might insensibly slip from her in her pain as she was on the vault, and it is usual for women to want to go to the close-stool oftener at such a Time than usual. She said such accidents had often happened to women where they have had all the help at hand. Mrs. Littlewood. I am a midwife, and was sent for upon this occasion on the 16th of January, about six in the morning, I was told how the child was found, and desired to look at it, to see whether it had been thrown in or dropt there accidentally; I observed the navel string to have been broke, I saw no marks of violence on the child; I went up and saw the prisoner, and by examining her found that she had had a child. I asked her if she was married, she said no; my opinion is that the child was at its time. She had a shirt, a cap, and other things for it, which I saw. Q Have you heard what Mr. Jones has said as to a conversation with his wife? Littlewood. I have, and she is right; such cases often happen to married sober women: a woman who had the same accident sent for me about three months ago. I was satisfied from all I heard or saw, that there was no murder committed in the case. For the Prisoner. Mrs. Clark. When this child was found I went and ask'd the prisoner if she had provided any things for it, and she said I should find some in such a drawer; I went, and taking out a bundle found the little things that have been here produced.

She likewise stood charg'd on the coroner's inquest for the said murder.* Susannah Dorwood . I am a midwife; I was sent for to Mrs. Dudman's; she told me she was afraid that Nanny was brought to bed, and the child was killed; I took a candle and look'd down the vault, and saw a child's feet; I went directly up stairs to the prisoner, and said Nanny, why could you put the child down the vault; she said she did not; this was between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning; I told her she did, and told her I saw a plain proof that she had been delivered, and had put the child down the vault; then she attempted to make me believe it dropp'd from her body in the vault; I had found she had been delivered on the boards in the vault; at last she told me she did; I went to Mrs. Dudman, and desir'd she would let me take the child out of the soil; she said, she was afraid she should come into trouble; I said, the jury could not sit till it was taken out; I went and took it out; the minute I got it up at the he ad of the vault the blood appear'd: I said here is murder committed, the head is almost off; I laid it down on the boards, and it bled prodigiously. Q. How long had it lain in the vault, as near as you can guess? S. Dorwood. I believe it might have been born between 3 and 4 in that morning; it stuck in the soil, and the soil kept the place together, so that the blood had no vent; I went up stairs directly; I said Nanny, how could you lay violent hands on it to draw innocent blood, said I, do you consider you soul? she made no answer; I said, where is your pocket? she said it was down stairs; I put my hand under her bed, and found her pocket, but there was no knife in it; then I asked her where the knife was, with which she committed the murder; she said in the knife-box; I ask'd what knife; she said one of her mistress's case knives; I look'd in the box, but looking on the other dresser I found the knife, that I suppose to be the knife with blood upon it. Q. Did the child appear to you to have come to the birth? S. Dorwood. It did. Q. In your opinion was the child born alive? S. Dorwood. Yes. Q. Where was this? S. Dorwood. It was at Paddington. Q. Did you examine the body of the prisoner? S. Dorwood. No, I did not, because every thing was safe from her body. Q. Was it a male or female child? S. Dorwood. It was a female. Jane Dudman . The prisoner was servant to a lodger of mine, she seem'd to be big with child; she had been but a fortnight in my house; when she had not been in my house above a week there was some grease upon the floor, I desir'd her to get it up; she down on her knees, and as she stoop'd, I said you are a good servant, but I fear you are spoil'd; I said are you marry'd (she appear'd very big) she said no, she never was married in her life. I was in my bed, and heard a person coming down early in the morning; I call'd who is there 2 or 3 times, at last I call'd aloud; she answer'd, it is me; are not you well, said I? no said she I am not well: I heard her go down stairs, and open the yard door; she was out some time. I was very uneasy. She did not come in; I got up and open'd the sash, and call'd to her; she said yes, Madam, I am a great deal better, I will come in presently; I believe she had been in the yard something less than a quarter of an hour. Q. Where was she when she answer'd you? J. Dudman. She was then in the necessaryhouse; then I went to bed, and did not go to sleep, I was afraid she would fall to pieces there; presently I heard the yard door open, she went into the kitchen, and open'd the window, I went to sleep; when my husband got up, my maid came up to me and said, Madam, I am frighted out of my wits, I am afraid Nanny has miscarry'd, she has mopp'd up the place in the necessaryhouse, and the kitchen too. Q. Is you maid here? J. Dudman. No, she is not; there was a person that lay in our house that night, and he said to me, there is something that should not be; my husband bid me go and see; I went, and saw a bad thing had been done: then my husband sent for a constable, and order'd me to lend for a midwife, which I did; then I went up stairs to the prisoner's mistress, and begg'd of her to go with me to the maid; she made us believe she was asleep; I shook her, and call'd to her, and ask'd her what wicked deed she had been doing, where is your child? at last she said it was down in the vault. I had seen the child before, but afterwards I saw the child's throat was cut. I said to her, how could you do this, there is an hospital ready, and if you had spoke to me but half an hour before I could have got it in. She never own'd to me that she had laid violent hands on it. John Gibbs . I am constable; I was sent for to the house of Mrs. Dudman. She told me, she was afraid her lodger's servant had been deliver'd of a child in the little house, and that she had made away with it, the child was taken out of the soil, and I saw it with the head almost cut off. I went in, and ask'd where the girl was; I went to her and said, was the child born alive. She said yes. I said, did it cry? she said yes. I said, what could be the reason of your murdering of it? she said, she did not know what to do with it. I said, have you any cloaths for it? she said, no. Said I, you will be hang'd. She said, O Lord, I hope not. Said I, is it your child? she said yes. I said, how did you murder it? with a case knife, said she. I ask'd her where the knife was? she said, in the kitchen. I talk'd to her a good deal, and ask'd her if she was in her senses; she said she was very well for the time, and that she was able to get up and do her business. I went down stairs and ask'd for the knife, and there I was show'd it. The next morning I apply'd to justice Fielding, and ask'd what I should do with her? he said, by all means fetch her, if she is able to be removed, there is one subject lost. don't let another be lost without punishment. I went and fetch'd her, and she confess'd the same before the justice; in the coach between there and justice Fielding's she never denied the fact; but said, she always intended to put it in the necessary. It was a female child (a case knife produc'd with blood upon it) Prisoner's defence. I did not intend to do it, I took the knife with me with intent to part the burden from the child; I never heard it cry as I am here alive. When I found what I had done I put it in the vault; I was by myself in the vault. Guilty . Death .

She was a 2d Time indicted on the Coroners Inquisition for the said Murder. Isabel Brown thus depos'd. I often told Mrs. Holiday, that I thought the Prisoner was with Child. - I went to see her one-Day when she was very ill, and had purging and vomiting, and there was Caudie in the Room, and then I believ'd that she was brought to Bed. Mary Stanford thus depos'd. On Sunday the 28th of August, between 7 and 8 in the Evening, I was sitting at my Door, which is next door to Mrs. Holidays in Pall-Mall, and her Maid Betty Franks was with me, and so up comes the Prisoner in a Riding Hood, and ask'd me how I did, I told her I had been very ill, And so have I too, says she, and after a little more Chat, she desir'd me to let her go to my necessary House, which I did, and she came back in about 2 Minutes, and staid talking with us about half a quarter of an Hour. On the 6 of September following, the Night Men came to empty the Vault, and found a Child, which they laid upon some Straw in the Yard, and said they must charge a Constable with it, before it was carried away. - It was a Male Child at its full Time, and I saw no bruises on it. William Brown the Night-man thus depos'd. Mrs. Holiday's Vault and this are both in one at the bottom, and there is only an Arch that parts then at top. I had empty'd 6 Tun, and was about the 7th when as I sunk the Soil, I saw something pop out of Mrs. Holidays Vault, which at first I thought was a Dog, but when I brought it up in a Pail, I found it was a Child. I believe it had laid there 5 or 6 Weeks, though it appear'd very fair, but I could give a pretty good ghess, because I had been such things before. Margaret Holiday thus depos'd. When Isabel Brown told me that she believ'd the Prisoner was brought to Bed, it was but about 7 or 8 Days before the Child was found; I never saw any sign of her being with Child, and should never have mistrusted it, if Brown had not put it into my Head. Elizabeth Powell the Midwife thus depos'd. The Child came at its full Time. I saw no hurt on it. It came into the World without the help of a Midwife, but whether born alive or dead, I cannot tell. I ask'd the Prisoner if she had ever had a Husband, she said no, I examin'd her Breasts, and made her draw her Milk, which I carry'd in my Hand to the Jury; Then I told her, that she had had a Child. She said no, but she had miscarried about 5 Weeks ago, when she was 4 Months gone, which I could not contradict, for she might have had Milk, if it had been 8 or 10 Weeks after such a Miscarriage. The Prisoners Confession was then read in which she owns; That being about 4 Months gone with Child, she fell down, in the Old Paved Alley in Pall-mall, and finding herself very much disorder'd with a violent pain in her Back, she went into Mr. Bowchers Vault, (which is not the Vault where the Child was found) and there while she sat on the Seat, the Child dropt from her Body, which was what she did not expect when she went thither. The Prisoner thus made her Defence. I am Married, but my Husband is at Sea, I kept it private for fear of displeasing my Friends. - But when I found my self with Child, I spoke to Mrs. Southwell, to provide me with a Midwife and a Nurse, and often desired the first Witness Isabel Brown , to help me to some Child-Bed-Linnen, and some I made my self, which I have here to produce. Eliz. Southwell thus depos'd. The Prisoner on the ninth of August last desired me to let her have my Room to lye inn, and to chuse her a Nurse and a Midwife. Isabel Brown thus depos'd. The Prisoner has often asked me to help her to Child-Bed-Linnen; and because I did not do it, she was very angry with me, and ask'd me how I could serve her so, and that was all the reason that I had to suspect she was with Child. Ferdinand Lanson thus depos'd. I lodge at Mrs. Holiday's I have been several People who did not belong to the House, go to the Vault where the Child was found, for there is an open Passage to it. I always believed the Prisoner to be a very sober modest Woman. A great number of Witnesses appeared in favour of her Character, and the Jury acquitted her."

Thomas Brown depos'd, That he heard a crying out for Help about One in the Morning, on the 11th of May, which Noise he did believe proceeded from the Prisoner's Room. Elizabeth Powis depos'd, That the Prisoner had for some Time before this been very importunate with her to come and be her Bedfellow, but she having a Husband could not have the Opportunity, except once when her Husband was out of Town, when the Prisoner exprest a great liking to her on occasion of her being a Lover of Children, and having had a great many.

Elizabeth Woolhead , Midwife, depos'd, That on the Wednesday after this happen'd, the Ladies of the House came home, and they being told of the Prisoner's Indisposition, were surprized at the Incidents as they were related; that they immediately sent for her, and desired her Opinion, whether she had bore a Child or no; That she took her up Stairs, and examining her, found Milk in her Breasts, and then told her she had bore a Child, which she deny'd knowing any thing of, tho' she said, when she took the Vomit from the Apothecary, she had a violent Purging, at which Time something came from her, which she could not account for; however, what it was, she slung it out of the Chamber-Pot into the Vault: She likewise told this Deponent, that when the Apothecary came to her, she told him, that the Custom of Women had left her for nine Months, and that nevertheless he sent her the Potion which brought away something Extraordinary, but yet she would not own that she knew herself to be with Child; but where upon this Deponent's giving her Opinion that she had bore a Child, and she was committed to the Compter, she sent for this Deponent, and told her she had made Provisions for the Reception of a Child, which were at her Master's, at the Bottom of her Box; and that she went and found there all manner of Materials suitable for such an Occasion. This Deponent further said, that as she had a hard Labour and no Help, it were next to impossible that the Child should come from her alive, at least, it would immediately die; and for the Child's being disengag'd from her, the Navel-String might break, and in the Extremity she might not be sensible of it; and further to prove the Child was not born alive, she said there was no Child but what cried out as soon as it was born, and that this Child never cry'd at it's Birth, appear'd evident from the Oath of Jacob Binks , who depos'd, That he lodg'd in the next Room, that he heard her Cries and Groans all the while, but that he did not hear the Cry or Noise of a Child. Upon the Whole, the Jury acquitted her."
1757-05-26,,1.0,,"687. (M.) Elizabeth Warner , spinster , was indicted for the wilful murder of her female bastard child, by strangling it , August 25 . She likewise stood charged on the coroner's inquest for the said murder. * Mrs. Smith. I am a midwife; I was sent for to the prisoner on the 25th of August by the officers of the parish, on a suspicion of her having been delivered of a child. I found her in the kitchen; I asked her how she did; and told her I was come to examine her upon a suspicion of her having been delivered of a child. She first said, she had had no child; she at last confessed she had miscarried; and said she was three months gone. She said she was at the vault, and it dropped from her as she sat. I asked to examine her; she said I should not. I examined her breasts, and told her I was sure she was farther gone than she had said. I advised the officers of the parish to send for Dr. Underwood. He came and examined her; he said, she had had a child. The prisoner said it was down the vault; we went to see if there was any child in her room. There was a box locked; I asked her for the key; she would not let me have it till I threatned to break the box open. I opened the box, and found a parcel of dirty things. I found the after-birth in a leather pocket. I looked farther, and found the child wrapped up in one of the prisoner's shifts and petticoats, dead. It was a female child; there was no mark of violence upon it; it had a membrane over it down to its breech; the blood was then fresh in the navel-string. Q. Was it warm then? Smith. No. Q. Could you judge how long it had been born? Smith. I should think from the appearance, not many hours; she said she miscarried on Thursday. Q. What do you infer from this membrane? Smith. It was owing to a very quick labour. I went into the kitchen to her, and asked her if she had any child-bed linen prepared; she said, No. Q. You said the child was in a shift? Smith. That was the prisoner's shift. Q. Was the child at its full time? Smith. I think it was: it was a very fine child, I saw her again the next day; I asked her how she found herself upon the child's coming into the world; she said, she helped it into the world. Q. Could you tell whether it was born dead or alive? Smith. I could not tell that. Cross Examination. Q. You say she said she was about three months gone with child? Smith. Yes. Q. After that I believe she said it might be four or five months? Smith. Yes; she might be four or five months gone; that was the most. Richard Jones . I was sent by the overseers to fetch Mrs. Smith the midwife. The prisoner was very obstinate, I believe for an hour; I stood upon the stairs and listened. They sent me for Mr. Underwood; Mr. Underwood staid, I believe, three quarters of an hour; after that Mrs. Smith got out where the child was. I was up stairs with her when she found it; I took the prisoner to the work-house. Catherine Mole . The prisoner lodged at my house at the time of this affair; she had been at my house just ten days when this affair happened. A gentlewoman in the house and I suspected her; I asked her if she was with child; she said, No, she was not with child, not married. Q. What condition of life was she in? Mole. I believe she had been a servant. I was acquainted with her sister, which was the reason I took her; she said she wanted a lodging for a fortnight or three weeks. She came down stairs on Tuesday, and had a pennyworth of twopenny; she looked very bad; I told her she looked very bad and very ghastly. I thought she was in labour; I sent my child up to her, to tell her I should be glad to speak with her, if she could come down. She came down, and sat upon a chair; when she got up, I thought something was the matter; I went up into her room and asked her; she said she had miscarried; I asked her where it was; she said, in the necessary; and that she was only three months gone. She came down stairs every morning to her breakfast. On Saturday morning she was very bad, the sweat ran down her face like rain; she appeared to be very weak; I suspected there was something more than a miscarriage. I went to Justice Wright's; he desired me to go to the overseers of the parish, and acquaint them with it. Q. Can you tell from what you observed, what day she might be delivered? Mole. I can't say; I thought on Thursday, because she told me then she had miscarried. Cross Examination. Q. Was any other lodger in the house? Mole. Yes, Mrs. Milbourn and Mrs. West; both married women. Q. Was Mrs. West's room near the prisoner's? Mole. Yes, it joined to it; there is only a partition between. Q. Where is Mrs. Milbourn's room? Mole. The two pair of stairs, just under the prisoner's. Sarah Milbourn . I lodge at Mrs. Mole's house. I saw the child taken out of the box by the midwife. I observed the prisoner to be with child before; I thought he was coming to the Middlesex Hospital to lie in. Q. Did you observe any marks of violence upon the child? Milbourn. No; it was a very fine child; it had a cawl over it. Cross Examination. Q. Did you in that week hear any thing like a child's crying? Milbourn. I can't say I did. Dr. Underwood. I was called to the prisoner. After a great deal of difficulty she was prevailed upon to go under an examination. I examined her, and was clear she had been delivered of a child at more than five months, a child at least six months grown. I did not see the child till the coroner's inquest sat, which was three or four days afterwards. There was a little circle round the neck, but no more than what might be in any part of a body that had lain some time. I believe it was a mark formed since the death of the child, by one part of the body falling over the other. Q. Could you judge either by the examination of the woman, or the size of the child, whether it was come to its full time? Underwood. I don't doubt it. Q. Can you judge whether it was born dead or alive? Underwood. I made the experiment upon the lungs. It is usually supposed that if the child is still-born, and the lungs have not been inflated with air, that they will sink; and that if the child was born alive, and the lungs inflated with air, that then they will swim. I tried part of the lungs in a bason of water, and they swam; but I told them before the experiment, that as the child had probably been dead four or five days, that the general air would in that time be let loose from the body, and the lungs might swim. I thought if it turned out in favour of the woman, it would be a proof that the child was still-born. Q. You don't reckon that experiment to be decisive from the child's having been dead so long? Underwood. No, I don't. If the child had been born alive, it would infallibly have died. From no ligature being made upon the navel-string, it would bleed to death. Q. Could you judge whether the child died by the loss of blood from the navel-string? Underwood. I should not have supposed by the appearance of the body, that it had lost any great quantity of blood; the body was red. Q. If it had died from the not tying the navel- string, it would have lost a great quantity, I suppose? Underwood. Yes; I never saw a child that died by the more loss of blood. Q. How soon would the child have died, if it had died by the loss of blood? Underwood. It would have died in a quarter of in hour. Q. How much blood do you suppose might come from the child in that quarter of an hour? Underwood. Five or six ounces, I should suppose. Q. So you can't form any opinion whether it was born dead or alive? Underwood. I own what the woman said to me had some weight. She was going to say something to me, and said she hoped I would be favourable to her. I begged her not to tell me any thing that would do her hurt. I told her she knew whether she was guilty or not; and if she was guilty, her best way would be to go away directly; she said, she would. Q. She did not go away? Underwood. She was guarded. Q. Will you say that in your judgement the child was born alive? Underwood. I cannot say. Q. Mrs. Smith says there was a membrane about the child; was it when you saw it? Underwood. No, it was taken off. Q. What was the cause of that membrane? Underwood. The labour must have been exceeding quick, or that membrane would have parted, and have turn off before the child was born. Q. What do you mean by the labour being quick? Underwood. That the actual birth succeeded the first pains very soon. Cross Examination. Q. How long did the prisoner tell you she was gone? Underwood. She said four or five months. Q. Are not quick labours often fatal to the child? Underwood. Long labours destroy a great number of children; but a great many more children are lost by exceeding quick labours; the safest labours are of seven or eight hours. Prisoner's Defence. I was but six months gone; I thought I had three months more to come. For the Prisoner. - West. I lodged at Mrs. Mole's, the next room to the prisoner; there was only a this door between her room and mine. Q. Did you hear any noise of a child's crying, or any noise whereby you might know that a person was in labour? - West. I have heard people speak in the room, but I did not hear any noise; I was not out of my room an hour from Thursday to Saturday. - West. I am husband to the last witness; I was at home between twelve and one that day; I did not hear a child cry. Mr. Allen. I am overseer. I sent for the physician and midwife; I was with the midwife in the kitchen, when the prisoner seemed a good deal confused, and indeed she seemed to be in liquor; I asked her to let the midwife examine her; she said she did not chuse it. Charles Johnson . The prisoner lived with me nine months, and was a sober, honest, good servant. - Lewis. I have known the prisoner from a child; she always bore a good character. Acquitted ."
1760-01-16,,1.0,,"Sarah Hunt , was indicted for the Murder of her Bastard Child , on the 10th of Nov . last; to which Indictment she pleaded Not Guilty. Mary Leg depos'd, That on the 9th of Nov. she suspecting the Prisoner to be with Child, charg'd her with it, but she stifly denied it, and that next Day perceiving her something less in Body they sent for a Midwife, who, searching, gave her Opinion that she had been delivered of a Child, which they afterwards found in a Trunk, wrap'd in a Flannel Petticoat; but it did not appear to this Deponent that there had been any Violence offer'd to it. Ann True , Midwife, depos'd, That she did believe the Child might be lost for want of Help in the Delivery, for it had neither Mark nor Blemish which might denote its being murdered Mary Tate depos'd, That the Prisoner gave her some Childbed Linnen to mend, sometime before the Child was born; and that furthermore, she had given her a Shilling to give Earnest for a Room, which she had actually taken for the Conveniency of her Lying-in. This being confirmed, and the Prisoner's saying, she did believe her Time of Delivery was not so near, and several other Circumstances concurning therewith, the Jury acquitted her."
1760-02-27,,1.0,,"Martha Busby , of Fulham , was indicted for the Murther of her Female Bastard Infant, by throwing it into an House of Office , the 3d of May last. Elizabeth Smith depos'd, That the Prisoner lodg'd in the same House with her, and she found a Child in the House of Office, wrapt up in a Piece of an old Blanket; that the Child appear'd to have been at its full growth, but was wasted, being suppos'd to have lain there several Weeks. Mary Sweatingham depos'd, That about a Fortnight before the Child was found, she being at Work with her picking of Strawberries, she ask'd her, If she did not hear a Child cry? saying, she had continually the Noise of a New-born Child in her Ears; that she going to the Prisoner in New-Prison, and asking her, why she did not make her Escape? She answer'd, she knew herself to be Guilty, and had no Power. Elizabeth Jones depos'd, That she going (about a Fortnight before the Child was taken up) to the Pond to wash a Mop, and the Prisoner at the same time going to wash a Tin-pot, the Prisoner bid her put her Hand upon her Belly, and feel how soft it was grown in a Weeks time, and she tracked her by some Blood, and also that she was another Woman than she had been for 10 or 11 Months; that she appeared then to be very lank, tho' she had look'd big before. Rachel Wright depos'd , That as she was gathering Strawberries, the Prisoner ask'd her the like Question as she had done Mary Sweatingham . Elizabeth Paul , the Midwife, depos'd, That in her Opinion the Child was at its full Growth. The Prisoner call'd several Persons to her Reputation, and the Fact not being proved to the Satisfaction of the Jury, they acquitted her."
1760-05-21,,1.0,,"10. Jane Cooper , of Heston, Middlesex , was indicted, for that she being big with a Female Bastard Child, by the Providence of God, did bring forth the said Child alive; and she the said Jane not having the Fear of God before her Eyes, &c. on the said Child so born alive, did, with both her Hands, make an Assault, and in a certain Linnen Cloth, value 1 d. the said Child did wrap, by Reason of which wrapping the said Child was then and there choaked and strangled; of which choaking and strangling it there died . November 8 . Anna Maria Margaritta Church. Mary Eldridge told me she had a Bundle left her by the Prisoner, and she was offended with the Smell of it. I thought, as the Prisoner was a Servant to a Butcher , she might have bundled up a Joint of Meat, and so I advised Eldridge not to conceal it: So it was carry'd to Heston Church House, and I was by when it was opened. There was in the Bundle a Shift and some Aprons, and a colour'd Apron next the Child, which was a Female, and which the Prisoner own'd to have been hers. She confess'd she had given Eldridge the Bundle to keep for her, and had ordered her to let no Body see it. When she was going before Justice Bulstrode, I asked her if she had made a Provision for it, and she said, No, she had not, for she concealed it, and intended it should be concealed. Q. Did you ask her if it was born alive? Church. She said it was not born alive; she had made no Preparation for it, and that no Body knew any thing of it but her self. Mary Eldridge . Last Monday was three Weeks, the Prisoner sent for me, by an old Man, and told me she was going away from her Place, and desired me to take a Bundle to keep for her, (whereof) I did: She took it from under a Settle, and it was sew'd up; when she delivered this Bundle to me, she desired that no Body might see, or meddle with it. I thought it had been her own wearing Cloaths, so I put it up on the Head of my Bed, and there it lay till the Thursday following. I discovered it by the Stink that came from it, and acquainted my Neighbours with it; we thought it smelt like stinking Meat, so it was open'd, and we found something in it all over Maggots, Filth, and the like; then we open'd it farther, and found a Female Child. We acquainted the Officers, and they sent for the Prisoner to an Alehouse, who there own'd she was deliver'd of a still born Child by herself, at George Greenwood 's, where she liv'd. The Child's Arm was broke and its Skull too, and the Face of it was very much mortify'd, which might be occasioned by its having been so long dead. Elizabeth Hutchins , Midwife. I was sent for by the Parish Officers to view the Child; it was at its full Growth full nail'd, and had Hair on its Head; it was very much maul'd, the Arm and the Skull were broke; and as to the Face it had none; no Eyes nor Nose, and the Skull was clasp'd one Part over the other; I cannot say whether that might happen without Violence or not, but the Arm was broke between the Shoulder and the Elbow; perhaps the clasping of the Skull one Part over the other, might be occasioned by her wrapping it up so close together. Defence. The Child was still-born, and never was alive in this World. I was delivered of the Child in my Service where I liv'd, and I call'd out, but nobody heard me, so as all was over and the Child was dead, I did not think of telling any Thing about it. Guilty . Death . She was indicted likewise on the Coroner's Inquest for the said Murder, and found guilty."

One Sunday, about seven Weeks ago, a little after 7 o'Clock in the Evening, I went down to the Necessary-House, at Mr Hughes's in little Jermyn-street , and saw a Bundle of Linnen lie in the Necessary-House: I was somewhat surprized, and accordingly I came up and desired Mr Hughes and his Wife to see what it was. They unrolled it, and said it was a Child. *- I did not see the Child till it was wash'd the next Day, I was so frightened; then it was laid upon a Table.

John Hughes . Mrs Gilbert , about the Time she speaks of, went down into the Necessary-Place, and came up very much frightened, and said she saw a Bundle of Linnen in the Vault (which is a Common-Sewer) endeavoured to be push'd into a Hole. She acquainted me with it: I let it lie that Night. Next Day I called to a Neighbour, and got a Pair of Tongs and took it out of the Vault. I pulled off one Linnen and then another, and discovered a Child's Hand and Arm. I was very much frightened, and went to a Justice of the Peace, to know what to do (for I did not know the Nature of the Affair) he ordered me to go to the Coroner. - It was discovered on Sunday Night between seven and eight o'Clock, but I did not take it out till Monday the 11th of October. It was a Male Child. When it was wash'd I laid it on a Table, in a convenient Place for the Jury to examine it. - There were no Marks of Violence upon it. Ann Tullock . I am a Midwife; I saw the Child upon a Table. There was no Appearance of any Violence. Q. Upon viewing the Child, how do you think it came by its Death? Tullock . I cannot say indeed. Q. Was there any Thing provided for the Child ? Tullock. There were some Things provided for the Child. Q. Do you know she was the Mother of the Child? Tullock. No. - It is my Opinion the Child came to its full Time, but the poor Creature was ignorant. Q. Do you think there was any Miscarriage? Tullock. I cannot be sure whether the Mother of the Child went her full Time. - I believe she might come pretty near to the Time. - She owned herself to be the Mother of the Child. Q. What did she say with Respect to the Death of the Child? Tullock. She said she was delivered of a dead Child, and that she did not think herself in Labour. - I believe the Child was born at a Relation's of her's in Piccadilly, at her Brother's; she was Serant there. Q. Did she tell you whether there was any Midwife attended on the Occasion. Tullock . She did not tell me that; but she told me the Child was carried and put into a Vault, to avoid her Shame. I asked her, if she had any Thing prepared for the Infant, and she said Yes; - It was after she was in Custody that she told me this; she said she had provided Things for the Child, and that they were in a Closet in the Room where she lay at her Brother's; and I went and found all the Things there as she said. Q. Was the Closet locked? Tullock . Her Brother was mov'd from that House to another. - The House was empty when I went to look for these Things; I got the Key of the Landlord, and went and found them there; these are the Things. - They are convenient Things for a Person in those Circumstances.

The prisoner lived servant with me. On the 8th of last month, about 8 o' clock in the morning, I heard the prisoner groan; she had complained of the tooth-ach before; I thought she had it again; she lay in the yard upon the stones: I went to her she said she was very bad; I asked her, if she was with child? She said no; I desired her to get up, she would not; said I if you will not go into the kitchen, go up into the one pair of stairs room and lie down on that bed; she did. I sent the girl up to her to see if she would have any breakfast, she said she could not eat any thing. After dinner I went up to her, and said, she must have something to eat or she would be worse; I made her some panado and carried it up: after that I sent the girl up, who gave her some more; and in the evening between 6 and 7 o'clock my husband and I went to a neighbour's house; when we came back, I sent the girl up to know if she would not come down; she sent word she would not come down that night; I went up, and when I came there I saw something I did not like. I thought to myself there must be a child born, I took up a corner of the bed, and under that was a child. I called her murdering slut, or something like it ; she made no answer, I drove her down stairs to her own bed, which was in the kitchen. Q. Have you had children? S. Cooney. Yes, I have. This child seemed to be at its full growth, but I did not examine its nails, my lord. Q. Had she made any provision for it? S. Cooney. She did say she had things at her mother's for it. Q. Did there appear any wounds or marks on the body? S. Cooney. No, there did not, my lord, or any settling of blood. John Cooney confirmed the testimony of his wife. Sarah Bull . I live servant in this family. After my master and mistress were gone out, in the evening I went up to see how she did, and carried her some panado, she drank it; when my mistress came home she went up and made her come down stairs; then my mistress ordered me to bring a candle, and there was a child wrapped up in two cloths, one round the head, the other round the body. Mary Rogers . I am a midwife. About half an hour after 10 that evening I was called out of my bed to this house; there sat the prisoner in a chair by the fire; I went to look at the child; there were all things together that should come into the world. It is my opinion the child was stagnated in the birth for want of help. When I came to clean it, there were no marks of violence upon it; the child was at its full growth, nails and every thing. James Atkinson . I am an apothecary. The child was carried to Shoreditch workhouse; there I viewed the body, I found no marks of violence upon it; I apprehend the child might be suffocated either in the birth or afterwards; but I am apt to think it was born alive, because there were settlings of blood interspersed all about the body. Q. Could it breath and yet be suffocated in the birth? Atkinson. Yes, my lord, it might. Eliz. Spires. The prisoner is my husband's daughter; she had some childbed linen at my house in her box; she had been at my house about a week before. I took the things out of the box. They were produced in court.

She would not go in; her master sent for her in; she went up stairs; after some time I found there were consequences which plainly proved there had been a child born; she was quite clear, and the other part she had made away. There was a great deal of milk in her breasts; I believed she had been delivered of a child within twelve hours. Q. Do you think the child was born dead or alive? S. Woan.

Then I went to my own room; I had no sooner been there, but I was ordered to go up and examine her again. I said, come young woman, you must unlace yourself, and go to bed. I examined her, and found she had borne a child, this was on Monday night. On the Tuesday morning, I went up to her again, she was up, sitting drinking tea. I said, A good morrow to you young woman, how do you find yourself. She said, Thank God, very well. I called her into a private place, and said, I shall be put to my oath, and I know you have had a child, let me know where it is. Said she, then I will tell the truth. I have had a child. - Was it born alive? - yes, it was. - Well, and what then did you do with it? - Madam; I strangled it. - You shock me so, that I have not power to say any thing to you. What did you strangle it with? - with a string. - You are ruined for ever. Pray who is the father? - a young man at a wholesale tobacconist's at Aldgate. - What did you do with it? - I put it into the copper-hole.
